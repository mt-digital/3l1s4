12 Q. Why? Fra 
13 A. Professionalism, technique. 13 
14 Q. What do you mean by that? 14

19 A. Just ~ 19 
20 Q. He told you? 20

23 Q. And what was the conversation that he had with} 23 
24 you that resutted in you becoming chief pilot, switching | 24 
25 positions with Dave Rogers? 25 








43 


A. Jeffrey would always critique Dave's flying 
capabilities, and | tried to help Dave and expiain to 
him what Jeffrey likes and doesn't like, And Jeffrey's 
aiso conveyed these likes and dislikes. And Dave 
maintained continuing with certain piloting techniques 
that were just not comfortable to passengers. And this 
‘went on through the years, and Jeffrey just got tired of 
it one day. 

Q. What specifically were Jeffrey Epstein's tikes 
and dislikes with respect to the flight of the plane? 

MR. GRITTON: Let me put in a form here. But 
| don't know what this has to do with anything in 
this case, 

MR. EDWARDS: | understand that, Bob. 

MR. CRITTON: | want to use this for some 
‘other depositions where we -- we've gone beyond the 
‘scope. 

THE WITNESS: The case in point, the last 
straw was there was a technique called quiet flying 
where you would retard the throtiles well short of 
the runway and pretty much glide the aisplane in. 
Well, if you doen't do that correctly, you have to 
‘spool the engines up just prior to touching down 
that — because you're losing air speed and it's an 
uncomfortable sound and feeling for the passengers 


44 


thinking that you're nat going to make the runway. 

And it was a continuous practice of Dave doing that 

to be neighbor friendly as opposed to being 

passenger-comfort friendly. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. 

A. Hence, the transfer of power. 

Q. Has he ever discussed with you where he wants 
you to be, whether that is "stay in the cockpit when | 
have people on the airpiane,” or don't intermingle with 
the passengers or anything else? 

A. He's never stated that to us. 

MR. REINHART: Could you clarify which "he” 
you're talking about? 
MR. EDWARDS: I'm taiking about Jeffrey 

Epstein. 

MR, REINHART: Okay. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. You understood that? 

A. Yes. 

Q, It's my understanding that in the -- well, 
teit me other than the Hawker, what other airplanes har 
you flown for Jeffrey Epstein? 

A. AGuifstream. 

Q. Does he still have that plane?

A. t don't believe it. 

Q. You don't believe that Jeffrey Epstein was. 
invotved with underage girls in a sexual way? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: You're asking for my opinion,

matter. 

BY MR. EOWARDS: 

Q. [think it's relevant. Can you just tell me 
whether today you believe that Jeffrey Epstein has 
engaged in sex with underage girls? 

MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation, irrelevant, 
always. 

THE WITNESS: It's irrefevant. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. I need an answer. 

A. {don't believe he had sex with underage 
women, 





Q. Or engaged in any sexual acts with underage

oF 


women? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. You think that this is just a story that a 
bunch of underage women have made up? 
A. Speculation. 

MR. CRITTON: Objection, Now its 
argumentative. Who gives a darn what he thinks one 
‘way or another? If he has personal knowledge -~ 

MR. EDWARDS: You'te objecting to the form? 

MR. CRITTON: it's argumentative. 

MR, EOWARDS: You're objecting to the form? 

MR. CRITTON: Yes. 

MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. [s that something that you believe that a 
burch of women — some of which know each other, som 
don't, some of which have been on the airpfane and some 
which haven't — made this up, that Jeffrey Epstein 
engaged in some sexual conduct with them? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: What | believe doesn't matter in 
this case, does it? 





68 


BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q |need an answer. Do you believe it? Do you 
‘believe these girls made this up? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

MR. REINHART: I'm going to instruct him not 
to answer. Move on. 

MR. EDWARDS: Is there a privilege that we're 
asserting? 

MR. REINHART: No, it's irrelevant. It's 
harassment and not likely to lead to discoverable 
evidence. 

MR. EDWARDS: I'm going to put on the record 
right now that it is -- we are allowed discovery 
into. a RICO count. We are also allowed discovery 
into the intent of Mr. Epstein in developing a 
ctiminai enterprise designed to sexually expicit 
and sexually abuse underage girls. We believe that 
in doing so, he associated intentionally with 
people of similar beliefs that sex with underage 
girls is okay, and that there have been many 
discussions with this witness, as well as many 
other witnesses with -— to insure his protection 
from law enforcement that they not answer these 
specific questions. And thus, the opinions and 
beliefs of all of these witnesses that we are 





Larry Visoski 












69 


alleging associated with this criminal enterprise 
are certainly reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence. And if you're 
still instructing the witness, based on that 

proffer, not to answer any of these questions, I'm 
going to continue to ask the questions and you can 
instruct him not to answer and we can go to the 
Court. 

MR. REINHART: My response is to his opinion 
whether people making allegations in this case are 
colluding or making up a story is irrelevant to 
what you just said. So | am going to instruct him 
not to answer any question that goes to his opinion 
of someone else's motivation or the truth of facts 
to which he has no knowledge. 

So yes, I'm instructing him not to answer. 

MR, CRITTON: Let me add in my part, is that | 
think -- you're certainly not only capable to ask 
questions with regard to what his personal 
knowledge is, and if he knows something or he has; 
reasonable basis for it; certainly you are entitled 
fo that information. | think you've asked those: 
questions and he’s given you straightforward 
answers as to what he knew or what he didn't kri 
under those circumstances, And as to what his 


70 


thoughts are on something which he has no factual 
basis or even an assumption to know one way or 
another is irrelevant. That's ultimately for a 
fact-finder in this case. 
‘While it's interesting, it's argumentative and 
{ don't think he's - 1 mean, do it on a 
question-by-question basis. if he has knowledge, 
that's great, but to argue your case with this 
witness or any other witness doesn't serve a 
purpose and | think is, you know — | think it's 
not a good use of our time, fil put it that way. 
But you know, you can go ahead and ask. 
MR. EDWARDS: | can ask the question and if 
the witness is being instructed not to answer, 
we'll let a judge decide whether he needs to answer 
the question and whether it's discoverable or not. 
MR. REINHART: Absolutely. Make your record. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Do you have any reason to believe that Jeffrey 
Epsiein engaged in sexual activity with underage women? 
A. thave no reason to befieve. 
Q. Okay. So as you sit here today, based on your 
18 years of knowledge, experience and observation of 
Jeffrey Epstein, is it your belief that he has not hag 
sex or engaged in sexual activity with underage women? 













October 15, 2009 






















71 


A. It's an opinion, and I believe that he has 
not. 

Q. Okay. Isn't it true that at some point in 
time you learned that Jeffrey Epstein has ~ strike 
that. 

MR. CRITTON: When you ultimately get to a 
good piace to break, will you let us know? 
MR. EDWARDS: Let's break now. 
(A break was had at 11:26 a.m.) 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Allright. Eighteen years of being a pitot 
for Jeffrey Epstein and in terms of being able to name 
somebody that you would say you've observed with Jeffrey} 
Epstein and would classify that person as Jettrey 
Epstein's fiend, can you name anybody? 

A. Nadia, Sarah; just people that we see 
routinely on the airplane. 

Q. That's peopie you see routinely in the fast 
five to ten years, right? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Prior to that time, anybody that you've 
noticed as Jeffrey Epsiein's friend may be Ghislaine 
Maxwell? 

A. What time frame? 

Q. is that a person that at some point in time 


72 


you would classify as Jeffrey Epstein's friend? 

A. [would classify it. | don't know if it's 
true. 

Q. But that's only because they were on the 
airplane together? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Do you know what Jeffrey Epstein does for a 
Jiving in your 18 years of observing and talking with 
Jeffrey Epstein? 

A. No. 

Q. Noidea? 

A, No, 
|. Ever asked him? 

. No, actually. 

. Ever been curious? 

Sure. 

Ever done anything to satisfy that curiosity? 
.. if you mean Google it, not really, actually. 

I mean, | really have not, 

Q. Okay. So in 18 years of traveling and being 
the pitat and driving -- and taking this person, Jeffrey 
Epstein, from one property in New York to New Mexico ani 
Florida and around the world, you have no idea what he 
does in terms of how he makes money? 

A. No, sir.

Sarah saying we're leaving tomorrow going to wherever,

won't. On a case where President Clinton wautd be on 
board, we would put a fittle extra catering on board or 
do that little extra TLC to the aircraft.

MIA and where is it landing?

MR. REINHART: Let me clarify this way: As. 
the passenger manifests, they are corporate 
documents of either JEGE or Hyperion Air, whatever 
company owns the plane. Mr. Visoski has physical 
custody of them. He retains them but they're not 
his dacumants. They're the corporate documents. 
So they're not in New York.

And the other name on that visit is Igor Zinoviev. Did 
you go with Igor to visit Jeffrey Epstein? 

A. Yes.

the same time. There was no apparent reason.

you? 

A. [don't recall who called and told me that he 
wanted to see me. | couldn't give you an accurate name, 
whether it was, you know, his attorney, Darren. And

Darren, his attorney.

said -~ 

A. Yeah, to go. 

Q. And what did you talk about with Jeffrey 
Epstein four days after he pled guilty to offenses that 
landed him in jait?

CRIHAHeYNHH 


October 15, 2003 


163 


just talked about general happenings that go on in 
there. 

Q. What did he say? 

A, it's terrible; it's cold; he can't sleep. 
They wake him up every two hours. You know, just item: 
like that, uncomfortable things. We talked about the 
airplanes a great deal. You know, we got major 
maintenance on the big airplane, so we discussed that a 
little bit, And then it was really just how 
uncomfortable he was there. 

Q. How jong did you visit with him on that first 
visit, July 3rd? 

A. [think we stayed the fuil hour. 

Q. Altright. Is that what the time aliofment 
was? 

A, tf believe itis, yeah, | don't think you 
could feave early, or 'm not aware that you could leave 
early, until later on we found out you could stay for 
five minutes or fonger. But | don't think any of us 
knew that was — once you got in there, you stayed there 
for the hour. 

Q. Okay. So you talked to him for an hour and 
for the most part it was just about the conditions and 
his disappointment with the conditions? 

A, Sure, yeah, absolutely. 


164 


Q. And did Igor talk to him as well? 

A. Briefly. | mean, not that much. You're going 
back a little ways again to remember exactly what was 
discussed. You know, he asked how his family was doing. 
i guess igor's got a son, | think he asked how his son 
was doing. You know, just general questions like that, 

Q. Did you ride to the jail that day with Igor? 

A. |} believe we did. | believe | met Igor 
probably at Jeffrey's house and picked him up, or if 
not, we may have met at the airport and drove together. 
But we did drive together on that occasion. 

Q. In what vehicte did you drive? 

A. The Hummer. 

Q. That's the vehicle you described eartier as 
the company vehicie? 

Yes, sir.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Have you been led to belleve that by anybody? 

A. No. 

MR. GRITTON: Form. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Do you have any — based on your observations, 
do you have any other opinion as to what role she plays| 
in Jeffrey Epstein's life, if any? 

A. 1 don't have an opinion on what the role is. 

Q. Do you agree with the criminal statutes that 
are in place to protect young children from sexual 
predators? Do you agree with those statutes? 

MR. CRITTON: Form, 

MR. REINHART: I'm going to direct him not to 
answer the question. (t's irrelevant and it's not 
likely to lead to discoverable evidence what his 
opinion is on a iaw that's been passed by the 
legistature of Florida. 

MR. EDWARDS: Just so the record is clear, i 
don't know that we did this last time, but it's 
been alleged in the complaint -- it has been 
alleged in several complaints that Jeffrey Epstein 
particularly prays on vulnerable disadvantaged 
females, underage females, and that in order to 
gain access to the muttitude of underage females,

he utilizes various paopie, schedulers, pilots, 
handlers and other associates and co-conspirators 
that have a similar mentality; that is, people that 
do not agree with laws related to sex abuse and 
abuse of children. And that's why this line of 
guestioning regarding whether or not this witness 
has a motive or a bias or was involved in 
conversations related to his motive or bias, to 
continue to work for Jeffrey Epstein or believed 
the same beliefs of Jeffrey Epstein, is at feast 
teasonably calculated to the iead the discovery of 
admissible evidence, and that is the argument at 
least along those lines being made to the judge 
regarding these questions. 

MR. CRITTON: Can we talk for just one minute?} 
Because maybe -- can | talk with — well, | know t 
can talk with Bruce. Let's just take a break. 

{A break was had at 2:45 p.m.) 

MR. EDWARDS: We're back on the record. Do 
you have the same position? 

MR. REINHART: Let me say this: He previoush 
said he would have never allowed anything on the 
plane to be done iegally. ff you want to ask if 
he agrees with the law applied by the 
legislature ~ do you agree the law passed by the 


180 


state of Florida should be compiled with? 

THE WITNESS: ! don't know what the law is. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. The laws In piace to protect children 
under the age of 18 from baing sexually touched, 
fondled, molested by people over the age of 24, do you 
agree with those laves? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And you agree that persons who commit a 
violation of those laws should be prosecuted? 

A. Persons that do that. 

MR. CRITTON: Form, 
BY MR. EDWARDS; 

Q. Yes, persons that do that. 

A. Persons that do that, absolutely. 

Q. And if you were to receive confirmed ~ what 
you would perceive as confirmed information that Jeffrey 
Epstein was one of those persons, would you continue to 
be employed by or alongside of Jeffrey Epstein? 

MR. CRITTON: Form; specutation, 
THE WITNESS: You're assuming that there's 
guilt, 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. No. ?m saying, hypothetically, if you were 

convinced that Jeffrey Epstein was guilty of those acts 





Larry Visoski 


WOAH RW 





181 


which he pled guilty to — 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

MR. REINHART: Can we -- for purposes of your 
hypothetical, what facts do you want him to assume 
are true? You said the facts to which he pied 
guilty, but the witness already said he doesn't 
know what he pied guilty to. He knows the charge 
he doesn't know the facts. 

BY MR, EDWARDS: 
Q. Solicitation of prostitution of a minor, 
somebody under the age of 18, 

MR. EDWARDS: That's the charge, right, 
Solicitation of prostitution of a minor? 

MR. CRITTON: No. | think you've got it 
wrong. I'll object io the form. 

MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Then weil handle the question this way: if 
you were to believe based on information and evidence 
that Mr. Epstein engaged in sex or some form of sex acts 
with people of the age range of 12, 13, 14, 15 years 
old, would you continue your employment with 
Mr. Epstein? 
MR. CRITTON: Form; specutation, 
THE WITNESS: | wouid certainly be speculating 


182 


and | have to discuss it with my wife long and 

hard. i don't think | could give you a correct and 

honest answer at this time. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. Given the allegations that have been 
made in this case, is this something that you have 
discussed with anyone other than your attorney? 

A, No, not really. Only from the fact that 
they're allegations and there's still a lot more work, 
I'm sure, to be discovered. 

MR. CRITTON: Let me put on there, for the — 
if this deposition is not typed -~ and we request 

it ~ I'd like at least this portion where 

Mr. Edwards’ last question back about five pages 

worth, so just if you could mark if from this 

page back about five pages. 

If nobody requests the deposition, I'd just 
like those five pages. 
MR. EDWARDS: I'm going to request the 
deposition, so... 
MR. CRITTON: Okay. We'll mark this then, so 
you could tell me where itis, approximately. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. ts there a reason why you have not discussed 





with Jeffrey Epstein the allegations that have been made}

against him and the allegations contained within many of 
these civil complaints on behalf of girs who were under 
the age of 18? Is there any reason why you haven't 
discussed that? 
MR. REINHART: If that's based on 
conversations you had with your lawyer, then don't 
disciose what you and your lawyer taiked about. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Correct. 

A. thave not spoken to Jeffrey about any of 
this, and it was my understanding that is illegal to 
have conversation about this, So I've never presented 
any questions to him reference this case or any others, 

Q. it was your understanding that it was illegal 
to talk to Jeffrey Epstein about the allegations made 
against Jeffrey Epstein? 

A. Yes, or anything to do with the case. That's 
why we never discussed any portions of it. 

Q, Okay. So - 

A. i may be wrong in that assumption, but ! 
don't - 

Q. So the reason why you haven't discussed this 
with Jeffrey Epstein is you believed it was illegal? 

A. Correct, yes. 

Q. Who led you te believe that it was illegal? 


184 


MR. REINHART: Again, if it was a discussion 
you had with any lawyer, then you can just give a 
name, don't give a discussion of the conversation 
you had. 

THE WITNESS: |t was my own assumption. | 
mean, just basic criminal knowledge of knowing 
you're not supposed to --.you know, if somebody's 
in trial or in a deposition or whatever, | don't — 

1 didn't think it was appropriate to discuss the 

maiter with them. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q, Okay. So the next two visits and | think the 
last two visits we'll talk about are on 9/6/2008. 
Actually, it looks like you visited him twice in one 
day; is that right? 

A. I don't think that's possibie. | mean, that 
will show how accurate the court record is. There's no! 


way. 

Q. You woukin't have visited him twice in one 
day? 

A. No. | think there's only one visitation per 
day. 


Q. Okay. And it looks like the same visitors 
éach time, except that it says for period three and then} 
the next one’s for period four. So there are two 


Larry Visoski 





COVA eR Whe 








185 


different periods. Was there ever a time when they 
allowed you to stay for more than an hour? 

A. No, not to my knowledge. 

Q. Okay. So again, it's Sarah Kellen and Nadia 
Marcinkova, same questions; Did you ever ask them theit 
involvernent with Jeffrey Epstein? 

A. Absolutely not. 

Q. And again, what was the discussion with 
Jeffrey Epstein along with Sarah Kellen and Nadia 
Marcinkova?: 

A. On the last visits, i was mainly airplane 
stuff and tater on in the visitations, we were advised 
that you could leave earty, so i would only stay for 
maybe 30 minutes and then, you know, Jeffrey would 
continue his conversations with them and then } would 
just wait outside. 

Q. Okay. 

A. So | would do my business with him tatking 
about airplanes or whatever | had coming up and then 
exit. 
Q. And then why did you stop visiting him in jait 
after that September Sth, 2008, visit? 

A. 1 was never called back to visit. 

Q. Okay. Well, shortly after that then he was on 
work release? 


186 


A. Well, that’s true. 

Q. Right? 

A, Yeah, 

Q. So the next times you would have gone to see 
him would have been at the Florida Science Foundation, 
where we talked about earlier? 

A. {ve seen him there, yes. 

Q. Okay. And in fact, I think you said you saw 
him 20 or 30 times — 

A. Sure. 

Q. - over the last two years, last year and a 
half or so? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And how long would you stay each time at the 
Florida Science Foundation and talk to him? 

A. Like my original answer, ten, fifteen minutes. 

Q. Okay. And how frequently would you talk to 
Jeffrey Epstein while he was at the Fiorida Science. 
Foundation? 

MR. REINHART: fm sorry, you're talking in 
person or all conversations? Because he testified 

he had phone conversations and personal visits. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. | was actually talking about phone 

conversations. So when you would call him on the

How frequently during a given week? 
Yeah. 
More specific? 
Sure. 
Depends upon what's going on that week. 
. I mean, is it somebody you would talk to him 
every day? 

A. No. 

Q. Allright. Weil, at that point in time, he's 
going from the jaif fo the Florida Science Foundation 
and back, and if you're not going to see him in person, 
and you're not corresponding by e-mail, then would you 
correspond by telephone, that either being you caii him 
or he called you? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And, you know, in any given week, what was the 
typical week like? | mean ~ 

A. How many times? 

Q. Yes. 

A, Maybe once in a week, sometimes twice in a 
day. | mean, it would vary. There was no routine, 

Q. And what would the conversation be? 

A. Mosily we discussed audio and video, TVs, hom 
theaters. [t's a niche of his and we're constantly 


188 


looking at new items that are out there, you know, 
what's the biggest LCD flat screen out there. 

Q. Okay. And since he's been out of jail and on 
community control or house arrest or whatever it is, 
where he’s located at his home now, have you visited hi 
at his home? 

A. Ihave been to the home. | havent visited, 
but | have had work to de there. 

Q. And have you cailed him on the telephone 
thera? 

A. Once I think I've called the house. Normally 
he calls me because it's usually he needs me to do 
‘something. 

Q. And what have those conversations been about 
since he's been out of jail? 

A. Let's put a stereo in the gym, let's put a TV 
in the fiving room, let's put a bigger stereo in the 
gym, let's put a bigger, bigger stereo in the gym, let's 
go redo what we've done. It's always audio. He's a 
very audio file person. 

Q. Do you know of any other modifications that 
he's made to the house at 358 E) Brillo since the tine 
that he went into jail?

li many, many young girls, there was no -- 

12 you've used it interchangeably with just 

13 young girls versus young girls who may have 
14 come to -- purported to give a massage and,

Q. Did she appear to you to be someone at 19 
least from seeing her and recalling her that she 20 
appeared at least to you to be while a young woman | 21 
appeared to be someone who was 18 or older? 22 

A. No, sir. 23 


Q. Okay. Well, did you ever say anything to 
the police or did you ever -- were you ever 





Page 348 
concemed about that such that you told someone? 

A. No, sir. 

Q. Haven't you told the police, sir -- let 
me strike that, let me ask it this way. 

In your taped statement that you gave to 

the police did you not tell them that all of the 
girls appeared to you to be 18 or above? 

A. Sir, as far as when all these actions 
that were taking place I was under an environment 
that I thought I was going to be -- in other 


words, I was afraid of any reprisal Mr. Epstein li 
and Mrs. Maxwell if I say something that is any 12 
idea of me because I have this confidentiality 13 


agreement, What I saw that they were very young, 


but I cannot say that they were 18 and old. 15 
Q. Right. Let me just take you back to my 16 
question again and see if you can answer my 17 
question. 18 
MR. CRITTON: Could you please read it 19 

back? 20 
(Thereupon, a portion of the record was 21 

read by the reporter.) 22 
THE WITNESS: I think I told the police 23 









Q. I'm sorry? 

A. Yes, I did, I told the police, 

Q. And at the time that you spoke with the 
police and gave them a statement, isn't ittrue, 
Mr. Rodriguez, that you were no longer employed by 
Mr. Epstein? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And you understood that you were required 
to tall the police officers the truth at that 
time? 

A. Yes, 

Q, And if f understood your testimony I 
believe from July 29th through today, you at no 
time asked any of these girls how old they were, 
True? 

A, No, 

Q. And as to whether the girls were under 18 
or 18 or over 18, you really didn't know one way 
or the other at the time. Would that be a fair 
statement? 

A. Yes. 

MR, WILLITS: Object to the form of the 
question, 
BY MR. CRITTON: 
Q. On Exhibit 6 there is a person who's 





























Page 350 
covered, the lady that Ms. Ezell asked you about I 
belleve was on the right-hand side of the 
photograph. There is a young lady on the 
left-hand side with a black hat on. 

Do you recognize her at all? 

A. No, I don't recognize her. 

Q. Okay, Thank you. With regard to the 
photograph four that you saw that you think 
possibly might be A.H., I think you told us that 
you recall seeing that woman in the sauna at Mr. i 
Epstein's house on one occasion and she was naked. i 

A, Yes, 

Q. Was that near the end of your employment 
or the middie or the front end? 

A. Tsaw her on January 2005, sir, and I was 
terminated in March, so that was two months prior. 
Q. And did you ever tell anyone that you had 

seen her naked in the sauna? 

A. I told Loueila, 

Q. Okay. And what did Louella say? 

A. She was surprised, 

Q. Okay. Did you wake the young lady up in 
the sauna? 

A. No. 
Q. And do you know how old the young lady

A All right. 

Q It's also very easy to say uh-huh or huh-uh, 
but it kind of looks the same on paper, so you can't do 
that either. I'm going to wait until you finish your 
answer, and you have to wait until I finish my question, 
because if we talk over one another, then the court 
reporter can't get it down. 

A Okay. Yes, sir. 

Q All right. So if you don't understand the 
question, tell me you don't understand and I'll try to 
ask a better question. 

A Yes. 

Q Okay. So you were hired in November of 2004 


to be the housekeeper for Mr. Epstein? 


A Yes. 
Q And when you were hired, who exactly hired 
you, who -- let me strike that. 


When you were hired to be the housekeeper for 
Mr. Epstein, who did you interview with? 
A Me. Maxwell. 
Q Is that Ghislaine Maxwell or just 
Laine Maxwell? 
A Ghislaine Maxwell. 


Q And where did the interview take place?

know the name of the person that lived at that 
house? 

A. No. 

Q. All right. In talking about this person 
Jean Luc Brunel, would -- you said he came here last 
week. He came here in January. Stayed three or

at Mr. Epstein's house? 

A. I don't remember. I don't remember. 

Q. Is he one of the people who frequently

A. Right. 

Q. How times would you estimate -- I know you 
told us two times in 2010. Let me ask it this way: 
In 2010 were there only those two occasions where 
Mr. Brunel was staying at Mr. Epstein's house in 
Palm Beach? 

A. Yes, as far as I remember. 

Q. Okay. How many occasions, in addition to 
those two, would you estimate that Mr. Brunel has 
stayed at the Palm Beach house since Mr. Epstein has 
been out on house arrest and also staying at that 
house? 

A. It's hard to tell. I would say maybe three 
times. 

Q. Three times in addition to the two times 
this year, five times total? 

A. No, three times total. 

Q. Okay. So, one time this month, one time 
last month, and then for the period of time from -- 
I don't remember when he was on house arrest, maybe 
July. So from July to December you think that there 
was only one other occasion when Mr. Brunel was at 
the house? 

A. You know, it's hard to remember but I think 


so. He was maybe totally three times for the last few

we can do a shortened answer. However you want 
to handle that, I leave it up to you. But i do 
agree that whatever the shortened answer is, 
that it will satisfy the length, lengthy answer 
that she would like to give. 

So, do we want to do that with this 
question, or how do you want to handle 

that procedurally? 

MR. RHEINHART: Well, I think I have given 
the instruction. [ think she, will give her 

the same instruction in the future to the

privilege. 

BY MR. KUVIN: 

Q. Are you aware that Alftedo Rodriguez has 
pled guilty to federal charges for hiding a journal 
containing the names of women? 

MR. RHEINHART: Objection to the form as 
compound and instruct her not to answer. 

THE WITNESS: On the instruction of my 
lawyer, I must choose to invoke my Fifth 
Amendment privilege. 

BY MR, KUVIN: 

Q. Do you have a personal fear of criminal 
prosecution as you sit here today? 

MR. RHEINHART: I instruct the witness -- 
object to the form. That's the whole basis why 
one would invoke the Fifth Amendment so clearly 
she's does. I am not going to have her answer 
the question. It's solely meant to harass. 

MR. KUVIN: So is she not going to answer 
that question? 

MR. RHEINHART: She's not going to answer 
that question. 

MR. KUVIN: I think what I need to 
establish is that she personally has a fear, 


Page 90 


not her lawyer. So I would like to establish 
whether the witness has a personal fear. 

MR. RHEINHART: Well, first of all, under 
the Fifth Amendment you don't have to be in 
fear. You just have to believe that the 
government believes you can be prosecuted for 
something. She's been invoking the Fifth 
Amendment on her own. It is implicit in her 
invocation in what she fears. She's not going 
to answer that question. 

MR. KUVIN: Well, I tend to disagree. She 
hasn't been invoking it on her own. She's been 
invoking it after you have instructed her to 
invoke it. So | want to know her personal -- 

MR. RHEINHART: You can take that up with 
the judge then. She's not answering the 
question. She's invoking her Fifth Amendment 
on her own accord based on the advice of her 
lawyer. And you can take it up somewhere else, 
but she's not answering that question. 

MR. KUVIN: Weil, then let me clarify the 
record. 

BY MR. KUVIN: 
Q. Ma'am, are you invoking your Fifth 
Amendment because you personally have a concern of

prosecution by either the State or the federal 
government? 

MR. RHEINHART: She's not answering that 
question. She’s not required to answer the 
question. She's invoked her Fifth Amendment 
privilege. She will continue to do so as to 
that question. You can move on. 

BY MR. KUVIN: 

Q. Ma'am, are you invoking your Fifth 
Amendment because your lawyer is advising you to 
invoke your Fifth Amendment, or because you 
personally have a fear that you might be prosecuted 
by either the state or the federal government? 

MR. RHEINHART: We bave now been down this 
street four times. She's not going to answer 
the question. You can move along or we can 
leave. 

MR. KUVIN: Iam just clarifying the 
question, and I appreciate it, And you can 
object. [ just want to make sure that I have a 
clear record of every possible machination of 
the question so that I don't get hit later with 
you didn't ask the specific question you need 
to ask, So, I'm not doing it certainly to 
harass, I just want to make sure that the 


Page 92 


record is very clear of my question. 


MR. RHEINHART: [| understand. Youcan § 


move on. 
BY MR. KUVIN: 

Q. Ma'am, have you had any direct 
communications with the State Attorney's office in 
the last two years? 

MR. RHEINHART: When you say "direct 
communications," can you clarify? 

MR. KUVIN: Yes. 

BY MR. KUVIN: 

Q. You, personally, have you spoken with 
anyone in the State Attorney's office in the last 
two years? 

MR. KUVIN: I can't imagine there would be 
a Fifth Amendment for that. 

MR. RHEINHART: Let me consult. If 
might. Okay? 

MR. KUVIN: Sure. 

MR. RHEINHART: It would all depend on 
what was said to her if she could consult with 
them now. For example, if they consulted and 
they told her they were about to prosecute, 
then there could be a Fifth Amendment claim, 
couldn't there?

16 clarify that?

MR. GOLDBERGER: What one case are you

of prostitution? 

A I don't understand the question. what's a 
crime, is that a traffic ticket? 

Q No. 

A Is it since I'm 18? 

Q Yeah, since you're 18.

Q I had asked you before if there were any 
other conditions of your plea, you didn't mention 
that, is that -- is there anything else that you 
haven't mentioned that's part of your plea

that one year? 

A I don’t know. ; 

q Have you made any. agreement with the 
United States Attorneys Office concerning a deferred 
prosecution or pretria! intervention-type of 
program? 

MR. GOLDBERGER: You know, I'm kind of -~- 

Mike is feeling the same way I am -- I'm kind 

of giving you leeway to_ask some questions here 

that may be arguably relevant but we're getting 
into areas that are not relevant and it appears 
to me that you're just asking the questions to 
embarrass Mr. Epstein so I'm going to give you 


a little more leeway but at some point I'm 
joing to cut it off if you go too far. £'11 
et him answer that. 
MR. GARCIA: I'm just asking about any 
agreements he made if he made an agreement. 

Have you made any agreements with the u.s. 

Attorneys Office to avoid being prosecuted for any 
federal offenses? 

MR. GOLDBERGER: The way that question was 
phrased, Sid -- 

MR. GARCIA: -- let's go back to the 
previous question, there was no objection to 
it. Read that back. 

(whereupon the following question is read back: 

3 Have you made any agreement with the 
United States Attorneys office concerning a 
deferred prosecution or pretrial 
intervention~type of program?” 


A Yes. 

Q And do you know what the agreement is? 

A Yes. 

Q what does the agreement cal? for? 

A The agreement states what it states. 

Q well, can you summarize it for me? 

A No. 

MR. BURMAN: Object to the form. 

Q Do you have an understanding of the 

agreement? 


MR. BURMAN: Object to the form. 
Q What is your understanding of the 


agreement? 
MR. BURMAN: Object to the form of the 
question. 
Q You can answer it. 


MR. GOLDBERGER: Can you give me a hint as 
to why you think that’s arguably relevant? 

MR. GARCIA: We may move to seek to 
enforce the agreement. We may add a count for 
just a third party beneficiary of that 
agreement for breach of contract claim. The 
possibilities are endless here. . 

MR. GOLDBERGER: That's fine, if you want 
to do that you can do that but Mr. Epstein's 
understanding of what the agreement is -- 
legally you can do what you can ~~ 

Page 12 


DEPO, EPSTEIN 
MR. GARCIA: ~~ he's a party of the 
agreement, his understanding of what the 
agreement is is crucial to whether or not there 
is a agreement and what the agreement and terms 
are.

Q Unless they instruct you not to answer, 
you have to answer the question and that question 
does not violate anybody's privilege against 
self-incrimination. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: Go ahead and answer. 

A Repeat the question. 

Q Sure. What is your understanding of the 
agreement made with the U.S. Attorneys Office? 

A That if I abide by al]_the terms and 
conditions of the agreement I will not be 


prosecuted. 
Q 61 right. Oid you sign that agreement? 
es, 
Q Did you have a opportuni ty to reflect on 
the terms of the agreement before you signed it? 
A Yes. 
Did you have advice of counsel before you 
signed it? 
A yes. 
Q All right. Was the agreement ever 
modi fied? 
A Yes. 


why was it modified, if you know? 


Q 

A (Nodding) . 

Q You don't know? You're shaking your head, 
but I don't know what that means. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: I think that would call 
for mr, Epstein to kind of reveal attorney 
client privilege so 1'11 advise him not to 
answer the question. 

MR. GARCIA: All right. 

Q who is Gerald Lefcourt, L-E-F-C-O-U-R-T? 

MR. GOLDBERGER: It would involve attorney 
client privilege. He's not answering that 
question,

signed the nondisclosure agreement that's why I 
have this, if that's what his question is. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: what nondisclosure 
agreement? 

MR. GARCIA: Apparently there is something 
the U.S. Attorney requires before turning over 
this document, you have to sign some sort of 
agreement not to disclose, if that’s his 
concern. 

MR, GOLDBERGER: It is of concern so let 
me clarify this. You signed some sort of 
nondisclosure agreement with the U.S. Attorney? 

MR. GARCIA: Yes. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: What U.S. Attorney? 

MR. GARCIA: whoever is handling this 
case. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: who would that be? 

MR. GARCIA: I believe it's -- she's the 
one who signed the agreement. There is some 
sort of protective order, if I understand, that 


was entered by Judge Mara requiring any party 
who is given this agreement to sign the 
agreement not to disclose it to anyone, marie 
Veafona (phonetic). 

MR. GOLDBERGER: So you contacted Ms. 
veafona and she had you sign a nondisclosure 
agreement? 

MR. GARCIA: That's why I don't want to 
make it an exhibit to this deposition because I 
don't want the court reporter to see it. I 
want to show it to the witness so he can 
identify it for me -- 

MR. GOLDBERGER: -- let me see what you're 
going to show him? 

(Handing) 

MR. GARCIA: Its got the addendum, too. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: So what's your question? 

MR. GARCIA: My question is did he sign 
the original agreement, did he sign the 
addendum to it and what dates did he sign 
those. I believe they're dated. 

MR. GOLOBERGER: I don't know how you can 
ask questions about a document that is not to 
be produced and make it part of a deposition 
without violating the non -- 


MR. GARCIA: ~~ well, I assume it can be 
produced to him and to his Tawyers. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: By acknowledging the 
existence of a agreement it violates the terms 
of the secrecy of the document, correct? 

MR. GARCIA: TI don't think so. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: I think it does. 

MR. GARCIA: I think it restricts 
disclosures to third parties. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm going to instruct him 
not to answer any questions about the 
agreement. If you want to see the judge on 
this, we can, if you're right, you're right; 
if you're not, you're not. Out of an abundance 
of caution I'm not going to have him answer any 
questions about jit right now.

A Again, I don't understand the question. 
If I was sued over the past 20 years in ten 
different cases -- I'm not sure of what case you're

in time you were served with a lawsuit, presumably

I don't remember. Ten years ago. 
More than ten years, less than ten years? 
Ten years, maybe more than ten years.

Q Do you know someone by the name of ~~ I'17 
read the same names again, not with the question 
about whether or not_you solicited them for 
prostitution at_Brillo way, I want to know if you 

now these people and if you're going to assert the 
same might maybe we can have the same stipulation. 
Do you Know any young women by the name of Britt, 
Alexis, Rhianin, Sherry, Nicole, Hailey or Joanna? 
MR. BURMAN: My objection is the same. If 
you are referring to a different person other 
than Hailey Robson, I really can’t object on 
form because you did give a last name. Is the 

Hailey you're referring to in this question a 

different individual or the same individual? 

MR. GARCIA: I assume the same individual, 
it's the same article which I produced to your 
firm which is available on a public site.

this question with regard to -- and not 
specified a last name, I would object to form 
and we would -~ Mr. Epstein would answer the 
question in the same fashion invoking his 
constitutional privileges and if we can have 
that stipulation it will save us some time.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes, that's fine. 
DIRECT BY MR. GARCIA: (CONT'D) 
Q Do you have any agreement with the u.s. 
Attorney's office to preserve your computer records? 
Yes. 
Q All right. Have you abided by that 
agreement? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm going to invoke 
attorney client oc vilege on that question. 
Q can you tell me who has control or who has 
the actual equipment? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Attorney client. 
Q who is Alexander Lian, L-I~A-N? 
A rt don't know. 
Q who is Palm Beach Marine? 
MR. BURMAN: Is that a person? 
MR. GARCIA: No, it's a company. 
You know who they are? 


No. I believe it's the lawsuit -- 

~~ is that the name of the company? 

t don't really know. 

Is that case still pending? 

I don't really know.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 


Being a witness in the notice heretofore 


filed, being of lawful age, and being first duly 


sworn in the above cause, testified on his oath as 
follows: 
THE WITNESS: Yes, I do. 
DIRECT EXAMINATION 

Q. {By Mr. Edwards) Can you tell us your 
full name for the record? 

A. Jeffrey Edward Epstein. 

Q. And what's your date of birth? 

January 20th, 1953. 

And your social security number? 

090-44-3348. 

And your current address in West Palm 
Beach? 

A. I intend to respond to all relevant 
questions regarding this lawsuit. However, at the 
present time my attorneys have counseled me that I 
cannot provide answers to any questions relevant to 
this lawsuit, and I must accept the advice or risk 
losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation. 


Accordingly, I assert my Fifth, Federal 





Palm Beach Reporting Service, Inc. (561)471-2995 





Constitutional rights as guaranteed by the Fifth, 
Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United 
States Constitution. 

Q. So you're unwilling to give us your 
address of your house in Palm Beach County? 

A. I intend to respond to all relevant 
questions regarding this lawsuit. However, at the 
present time my attorneys have counseled me that I 
cannot provide answers to any questions relevant to 
this lawsuit or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right 
to effective representation. 

MR. EDWARDS: Mr. Goldberger, can we enter 
into an agreement so that we all know that he's 
reading off of that piece of paper, we know 


what the whole spiel is, but maybe he can just 


say fifth or same answer or something like 


that, so we can continue to move on, rather 
than read that paper the entire time? We'll be 
here for days. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: I think out of an 
abundance of caution it's probably appropriate 
that whatever we feel is the proper response 
is, so that our invocation of our Fifth 
Amendment privileges is properly protected, 


so I think we're going to have to give the full 





Palm Beach Reporting Service, Inc, (561)471-2995 








length -- 
MR. BURMAN: Obviously we can't tell what 
you're going to play to a jury without the 


entire spiel, what questions you might play to 


a jury if you decide to do that when this case 


is tried, so we're going to go with the entire 

spiel to every question you ask. If -- that's 

Mr. Goldberger's representation, or 

recommendation, 

MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: We will go question by 
question, and we may or may not invoke Fifth 
Amendment privileges and there may be times 
where I'm going to have to think about it, 
discuss it with Mr, Burman whether we're going 
to invoke on any particular question, but on 
those questions that we do invoke Fifth 
Amendment privileges, I think we have no choice 
but, as you say, do the entire spiel. 

Q. (By Mr. Edwards) Can you tell me the 
addresses of other homes that you own outside of 
West Palm Beach? 

A. I intend to respond to all relevant 
questions regarding this lawsuit. However, in the 


present my attorneys have counseled me that I cannot 





Palm Beach Reporting Service, Inc. (561)471-2995 








provide answers to any questions relevant to this 


lawsuit, and I must accept the advice or risk losing 


my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation. 
Q. Have you seen any -- 

MR, GOLDBERGER: And, excuse me, and your 
Fifth Amendment privileges. 

THE WITNESS: Yes. 

Accordingly, I, excuse me, I assert my 
Federal Constitutional rights as guaranteed by 
the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteen Amendments of the 
United States Constitution. 

Q. (By Mr. Edwards) Have you seen any 
psychologists or psychiatrists in your life? 

MR. GOLDBERGER: Go ahead. 

THE WITNESS: I intend to respond to all 
relevant questions regarding this lawsuit. 
However, at the present time my attorneys have 
counseled me that I cannot provide answers to 
any questions relevant to this lawsuit, and TI 
must accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth 
Amendment right to effective representation. 

Accordingly, I assert my constitutional 
rights as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth and 


Fourteenth Amendment of that constitution, 





Palm Beach Reporting Service, Inc. (561)471-2995 





Q. (By Mr. Edwards) Tell me the names of all 
the businesses in which you are affiliated in any 
way?

questions regarding this lawsuit. However, at the 


present time my attorneys have counseled me that I 


cannot provide answers to any questions relevant to 
this lawsuit, and I must accept this advice or risk 
losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation. 

I also assert my Federal Constitutional 
Rights as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and 
Fourteenth Amendments to the United States 
Constitution. 

Q. My understanding is you're currently 
serving a 12-month jail sentence, is that correct? 

MR. GOLDBERGER: You can answer, but -- 
THE WITNESS: No. 

Q. (By Mr. Edwards) You were currently, you 
were initially sentenced to 18 months in jail, is 
that correct? 

MR. GOLDBERGER: Go ahead. 
THS WITNESS: Yes. 
Q. {By Mr. Edwards) And at the present 


moment are you still under the supervision of that

Q. Do you know what your release date will 


No. 
You have not been told the date of your 
release? 
A. Not yet. 
Q. Where do you plan to reside when you're

present time my attorneys have advised me that I 


must accept the advice, advised me not to answer 


those questions. I must accept their advice or risk 


losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation. 

Accordingly, I assert my Federal 
Constitutional right as guaranteed by the Fifth, 
Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution. 

Q. Mr. Epstein, I have a videotaped copy of 
the plea colloquy where you pled guilty and told 
that judge you would be residing in West Palm Beach, 
Florida. Are you saying now that the statement you 


made to that judge is no longer true? 





Palm Beach Reporting Service, Inc. (561)471-2995 





iL 


A. Sorry, could you repeat the question? 


Q. Sure. 

I have a videotaped copy of the plea 
colloquy -- 

A. No, the question before that, That's -- 
okay. 

Q. The question is, where do you intend to 
reside once you are released from jail?

questions regarding this lawsuit. However, at the 
present time my attorneys have counseled me that I 
cannot provide answers to any questions relevant to 
this lawsuit, and I must accept their advice or risk 
losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation. 

Accordingly, I assert my Federal 
Constitutional right as guaranteed by the Fifth, 
Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution. 

Q. As you know, that question was asked to 
you when you pled guilty last June in 2008, and you 
responded to the judge that you planned to reside in 
West Palm Beach, Florida. Is that no longer your 
intent? 


A. I intend to respond to all relevant 





Palm Beach Reporting Service, Inc. (561)471-2995 


12

present time my attorneys have counseled me that I

losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation. 

Accordingly, I assert my Pederal 
Constitutional right as guaranteed by the Fifth, 
Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution. 

Q. This deposition is not being taken in the 
county jail, but rather in your attorney, Jack 


Goldberger's office, so can you please inform the 





jury as to your current schedule as it is exists 
today? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Let me hold off on that. 
Okay. 
THE WITNESS: I don't understand the 
schedule, the question. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Yeah, if you can just, if 
you can rephrase the question, I think we can 


answer it for you. 


Q. (By Mr. Edwards) Okay. Currently you 
described that you're under the supervision of the 
} jail sentence at this point in time, you're within 


the 18 months of your jail sentence. But this isn't 





Palm Beach Reporting Service, Inc. (561)471-2995 





13 


a jail setting, so obviously you're outside of the

work release versus the hours that you are confined 
to the jail? 

A. Repeat the question, please. 

Q. What are the hours that you are out on

you are inside the jail, meaning if you report back 





Palm Beach Reporting Service, Inc. (561)471-2995

morning, tell me that.

providing me an answer as to where you currently 


work, would somehow incriminate you? 

MR. GOLDBERGER: Let's not be 
argumentative. He responded to the question on 
advice of counsel, and if you think that was an 
improper invocation, then you have a remedy, 
but don't argue with the witness, which is what 
we did. Okay.

leave the country once you're released from jail?

addition to my client's assertion of his 
rights, also object on the grounds that

to talk outside. 

THE WITNESS: Me, too? 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the record at 
2:35. 

(Thereupon, a brief break was taken.) 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the 
record at 2:36. 

MR. BURMAN: For the purposes of the 
record, I will tell you that this line of 
questioning, in my view, is way beyond the 
bounds of permissible discovery-type questions, 
and nothing but pure argument, and if you 
continue in this vein, I will stop the 
deposition and we will seek instruction from 
Judge Hafele about what's permissible and 


what's not. 


Q. {By Mr. Edwards) Isn't it true that at 


4 the time you were inserting your fingers into the 


vagina of these little kids, all you cared about was

your own sexual gratification? 


MR. BURMAN: The deposition is over. 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Conclude at 2:37, end 
of tape 2 of 2. 

MR. BERGER: We're going to order instant 
copy, and we want the tape, also, 
Mr. Videographer. 

MR. BURMAN: We want this as soon as they 
get theirs, we want ours.

PROSE COURT REPORTING AGENCY,

Either one of you can represent Mr. Epstein, 

but I don't want objections flying from both 

chairs, both Mr. Epstein's criminal lawyer and his 

civil lawyer, 

So I'd ask you to please choose which one is 
going to object, just like Judge Hafele has 

required at hearings that only one attorney can 

represent Mr. Epstein in an argument at a hearing. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: Actually, we have two 
different roles in this matter, [ represent 

Mr. Epstein on all criminal matters, so I'm going 

to speak when I think it's relevant to any criminal 

matters. And Mr. Pike represents Mr. Epstein on 

any civil matters, and he will speak when it's 
relevant to any civil matters, 
BY MR. KUVIN: 

Q. Okay. Sir, can I please have the paper back, 
which has already been marked as Exhibit 2? 

MR. KUVIN: Mr. Goldberger, if you choose that 
this document is not to be produced in this case, I 
have no objection to you sealing that document 
until such time as Judge Hafele decides the issue 
as to whether or not I'm allowed to mark something 
that the witness is reading in a deposition. Is 
that fair i you?

you're required to live at that address pursuant to the 
sexual offender flyer and pursuant to the Court's order 
convicting you based on your guilty plea.

Q Okay. What do you understand to be the terms 
of this no-contact order that you believe you were 
provided at a later date? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: If you know, 

THE WITNESS: Just to have no affirmative

MR. GOLDBERGER: Be specific. 

THE WITNESS: -- with -- with -- with three

MR. HOROWITZ: Let me just nip this in the 
bud. A witness -~ 

MR. GOLDBERGER: I~ I am just trying to help 
you along here, 

MR. HOROWITZ: Okay. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: No problem. You can -- you 
can ask the questions, and it will take an hour 
later. T'm trying to get you an answer that you 
want, 

MR. HOROWITZ: I appreciate that. If 1 -- and

it. 
MR. HOROWITZ: Allright. I'm going to put 
this on the record again. The local rules provide 
that in a deposition in a civil case one witness, 
one attorney who can object, period. It doesn't 
say if there is also a criminal case, two attorneys 
can speak. So if Mr. Epstein wanted to hire an 
attorney familiar with his criminal case for his 
civil case, he could have done so. If he didn't, 
that was at his own peril, So I'm just going to 
ask you to refrain, and I'm just going to put you 
on notice that if you -- if you interject an 
objection ~ 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Uh-huh, 
MR. HOROWITZ: -~- I'll seek the relief from the 
Court, and that's -- that's it, but -- 





MR. GOLDBERGER: That's fine. And I'm going tdi 


continue to do so, and if you want to adjourn at 

this point, we can do that. But if | think it's an 

issue relevant to my representation of him on a 

pending criminal case, I'm going to do so, okay? 
MR. HOROWITZ: Okay.

not your assistance, but the fact that you're 
speaking up, and you're familiar with the local 
rules. 

MR. PIKE: Yeah, let me -- 

MR. HOROWITZ: No, no, no. 

MR. PIKE: J know, I understand. 

MR. HOROWITZ: No, no ~~ 

MR. PIKE: Listen, we have got a -- we've got a 
jong day ahead of us, so fet's move along. 

MR. HOROWITZ; This is -- this is in the 
interest of efficiency. 

MR. PIKE: Okay. Let's go. 


MR. HOROWITZ: Per witness, one attorney, okay? 


I don't care who it is, but it can only be one of 
you. 

MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. So here's the deal: 1 
represent Mr. Epstein on his criminal cases. If T 
feel it is important for me to interject on issues 
relevant to his criminal case, I'll do so. 
Mr. Pike has taken the -- the lead role in 
representing Mr. Epstein civilly. 

MR. HOROWITZ: Well -- 

MR. GOLDBERGER: If there are issues relevant 
to the criminal case, I'm going interject. 

As far as your concern about what just occurred 


MR. GOLDBERGER: And you'll -- you're free to| 
seek whatever relief you want. 

MR. PIKE: And -- and let me -- let me put 
something on the record, since you chose to do so. 
One, this is -- this proceeding has a quasi- 


MR. GOLDBERGER: That's the only reason I did. 


criminal component to it, and your questions today, f 


Mr. Horowitz, are interjected in a manner in an 
attempt to cause Mr. Epstein to waive his Fifth 
Amendment Right, along with his Sixth and his 
Fourteenth which are incorporated therein. So the 
fact that Mr. Goldberger is here making sure that 
his client and my mutual client maintain and 
preserve those privileges that are afforded under 
the United States Constitution, he will continue to 
do that today, okay? 

Now, we're here to answer your questions. 
We're here to move forward with the depo. We'd 
like to do that. If you'd like to adjourn to take 
this up with the Court today, we could do that as 
well, but it was -- it's your choice.

THE WITNESS: Sorry? 
BY MR. HOROWITZ: 
Q With respect to S.G., do you acknowledge she 
has been to your home? 
MR. PIKE: Same objection. 
THE WITNESS: On advice of counsel -- I would 
like to answer al] your questions today, 
Mr. Horowitz. I'm sorry your partner that was 
disbarred is not here, because I would like to 
answer his questions because I believe he was the 
one who represented S.G. So 1 would like to see 
Mr. Herman at some point when he gets -- 
potentially gets his license back. But, though I 
would like to answer your questions in more detail, 
on advice of counsel, | am going to have to assert 
my Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights 
under the U.S, Constitution. 1 would like to 
answer the question, but my counsel has told me 
that J risk losing their representation if I do, 
so, therefore, I'm going to have to assert those 
rights.

some point in future I would like to answer that. 

Today, unfortunately, 1 am going to have to assert [; 

my Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights } 

under the U.S. Constitution because my counsel has|

question, I cannot today.

Q Are you suggesting, sir, that S.G. fabricated

association with a disbarred attomey?

THE WITNESS: It's not an attorney who's been 
disbarred. { believe J said it's your partner that 
was disbarred when -- after representing S.G., and 
L would like -- though I would like to answer those 
questions in detail, today I have been advised by 
counsel that I cannot answer any questions that may 
be relevant to your lawsuits -- 

MR. HOROWITZ: All right. 

THE WITNESS: -- and —- excuse me. 

MR. HOROWITZ: Go ahead, finish. 

THE WITNESS: Thank you. And, though I would 
like to answer the questions, and [ know you keep 
trying to strike my answer with respect to $.G.'s 
representation by your former partner, Jeffrey 
Herman, who was disbarred, who held press 
conferences to try to make a big -- so he tried to 
embarrass me as best as he could, I'm -- I would 
like to answer those questions, but I cannot on 
advice of counse). 

BY MR. HOROWITZ: 
Q Okay. And do you fee! that because my partner, 





Jeffrey Herman, was an attomey involved in S.G.'s case, } 


that somehow the allegations she’s made against you are 
fabricated or embellished? 
A I'd let -- the ladies and gentlemen of the jury 


Page 47 


because Jeffrey Herman was involved in the 
representation of S.G., that her allegations of abuse by 
you are fabricated or embellished? 
MR. PIKE: Form, predicate, foundation. 
THE WITNESS: J would very much like to answer 
the question regarding $.G. -- which 
embellishments, as you've described them, or 
fabrications -- at the same time she met your 
partner that was later disbarred. However, as of 
today, though I would like to answer those 
questions -- and I think those answers are pretty 
obvious -- | am going to have to assert my Fifth ki 
Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment 
Rights under the U.S. Constitution. 
And, though | think again those -- that answer 
is obvious, and will be obvious to most people here 
on the jury, my attorneys have advised me I cannot 
answer that question today. 
BY MR. HOROWITZ: 
Q Okay. You told us that in addition to S.G., 
you were also ordered to have no contact with Jane Doe 
103 and A.D.; is that correct? 
A Excuse me, yes. 
Q And when did you receive such an order? 
MR. PIKE: Form.

will make that decision, I'm sure. J can't -- | would 
like to answer those questions. [ would really like to

But today, on advice of counsel, I'm not going to be 
able to answer those questions. ] am going -- 
Q Well--

please. Is that okay? 
Q Well, you keep repeating yourself. 
THE WITNESS: Mr. Pike? 
MR. PIKE: Go ahead and finish. 
Please allow -- allow the witness to finish his 
answer. 
THE WITNESS: So let's start -- should -- could 
you repeat the question, please? 
MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. 
{The pending question was read back by the 
court reporter.) 
MR. HOROWITZ: That wasn't exactly the 
question, but I'l] ~- let me ask it again. Maybe 
it will be smoother, and just try and follow what 
it is I'm asking. 
THE WITNESS: I'm trying my best. 
BY MR. HOROWITZ: 
Do jeve, ag we sit here tod: 





THE WITNESS: I don't recall. 
BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q Okay. Was it~ if I heard you correctly, it 
was in association with your criminal case? 

A That's correct. 

Q Okay. And with respect to Jane Doe 103, do you 
acknowledge that she has been to your home? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Again, I would like to answer 
most of your questions. However, today, as I've 
answered most -- almost all of your questions and 
wil] continue to answer, on advice of counsel, [ 
believe, this question, I have to assert my Fifth 
Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth Amendment 
Rights under the U.S. Constitution. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q. Okay. And -- are you done? 

A (No verbal response). 

Q Do you acknowledge that Jane Doe 103 came to 
your home for sexual contact during her childhood, and 
that you paid her for those services?

possibly, if you can. 
BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q You've asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege to 
various questions I've asked you about Jane Doe 2. My 
question is: Is there any reason in your mind, absent 
anything you've spoken to with your attorney about, wh 
the jury should not infer from your assertion of the 
Fifth Amendment privilege, that you in fact sexually 
abused Jane Doe 2? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Well, I believe, Mr. Horowitz, 
the Fifth Amendment is by the Supreme Court's 
ruling. It's, in fact, used to protect the 
innocent, as well as certain people that might be 
not guilty. So in response to that question, with 
the fact that Jane Doe 2 -- the jury will 
understand that Jane Doe 2's lawsuit brought by a 
partner of yours who's been disbarred, constant -- 
after, in fact, he brought the lawsuit, well -- the 
jury, I have a strange feeling will -- sorry —- the 
jury, J believe, will understand that my taking the 
Fifth Amendment is only as a result of my counsel 
advising me today that I must do so, because if I 
don't do so, I risk losing their representation,

money from Florida investors, from Florida people, 

I'd like to answer each and every one of your 

questions, Mr. Horowitz, but today, on advice of 

counsel, I cannot. 
BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q_ Sir, you touched Jane Doe 3's breasts, buttocks 
and genitals while she was still a minor after she told 
you she did not want you to touch her; isn't that right? 

MR. PIKE: Form, asked and answered. 

THE WITNESS: I'd like to answer each and every 
one of your questions today, Mr. Horowitz, 
however, upon advice of my counsel } cannot. 
They've asked me -- they've required me fo assert 
my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment and Fifll 
Amendment Rights as provided by the U.S. 
Constitution to any questions that may be relevant, 
or may become relevant to this lawsuit, So, though 
your partner was disbarred after you filed this 
claim, or your firm filed this claim, Mr. Edwards 
who sits next to you, his partner sits in jail, so 
Fd like to answer each one of these questions. 
However, today, on the advice of counsel, I cannot. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q Did you try to persuade Jane Doe 3 that it was 

okay for you to touch her breasts and genitals? 


Page 115 q 


like in response to most of your other questions 

here today, I cannot. On the advice of counsel, 

they've told me I must accept their advice or risk 

josing their representation. They've advised me 

that [ must assert my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth 

Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights. So, though 

your partner, Jeffrey Herman, was disbarred after 

filing these cases, disbarred, no longer an 

attorney, Mr. Edwards' partner who sits to your 

right, his partner sits in, I believe, Saint Lucie 

Jail according to today -- today's newspaper, 

accused of perpetrating the largest fraud in South 

Florida history against people like me, crafting, 

fabricating, malicious sexually charged —~ cases of 

a sexually charged nature in order to fleece 

investors, I would like to answer that question. 

However today, I must accept my client's + 

attorney's advice. 
BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q Mr. Epstein, did you instruct S.K. to take Jane 
Doe 3's name and telephone number for the purpose of 
calling her home -- strike that. 

Did you instruct S.K. to take Jane Doe 3's name 
and telephone number for the purpose of calling Jane Doe 
3 to come to your home for sexual activity?

MR. PIKE: Form. 

THE WITNESS: I would like to answer each and 
every one of your questions here today, 
Mr. Horowitz, however, upon advice of counsel, I’m 
-» they've required me to assert my Fourteenth 
Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendmen’ 
Rights as provided by the U.S. Constitution. So, 
although I would like to answer that question, and 
respond to questions posed by you, for, I guess, 
your partner, Mr. Herman, who has been disbarred by 
the Florida Bar Association after filing these 
cases, disbarred, or Mr. Edwards' partner who sits 
next to you, has filed other cases where his 
partner sits in jail for fabricating cases, trying 
to get money from Florida investors, I'd like to 
answer each one of your questions here today Mr. 
Horowitz, but upon advice of counsel, they've 
advised me that if I do so, I risk losing their 
representation, so | must accept their advice. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ:

abused Jane Doe 3 when she was a child, do you? 

MR. PIKE: Form.

MR. PIKE: Form, asked and answered. 

THE WITNESS: I would like to answer every one 
of your questions, Mr. Horowitz, posed here today. 
Unfortunately, | guess, your -- your other partner 
who filed these lawsuits has been disbarred in the 
interim by the Florida Bar Association, so he's not 
here today. However, I'd like to answer those 
questions, but my counsel has told me that I have L 
to assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and [2 
Fourteenth Amendment Rights as provided by the U.S. 
constitution. So, though I would like to answer 
your questions, Mr. Edwards' questions whose 
partner sits in jail for perpetrating one of the 
largest frauds in South Florida's history, accused 
by the U.S. Attorney -- his firm accused by the 
U.S. Attorney is now -- the firm is bankrupt by 
perpetrating the -~ one of the largest frauds in 
South Florida's history and being called a criminal 
enterprise by the current South Florida's U.S, 
Attorney, I would like to answer every one of your 
question, very much so, however, my -- on advice of 
counsel, I cannot do so here today.

the Fifth Amendment should be used by people who 6

MR. PIKE: No, actually before we take a

MR. HOROWITZ: Okay. 

MR. PIKE: -- my understanding was, is that you

going for another 10 minutes, we'll go for another

minutes, go grab something to eat, and then come 
back, 
MR. HOROWITZ: Yeah. I mean, this line of

fo assert my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment 

and Fifth Amendment Right, though I'd like to 

answer that question. 

Td also like to correct some of the ~ a. 
previous statement I made regarding your partner 
that he had been disbarred. { understand he wasn't 
disbarred, but he was simply suspended for improper 
behavior, suspended by the Florida Bar. So I would 
like to make the correction that he's not totally 
disbarred, but he’s no longer practicing for the 
time being, So -- but on advice of counsel, at 
least with respect to this question, or any 
question that may be relevant to this lawsuit, my 
counsel has told me I must assert those rights. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q Okay. And if I'm hearing you correct, your 
testimony that Mr. Herman was disbarred is -- was 
erroneous; is that right? 

MR. PIKE: Form, 

THE WITNESS: My testimony that your partner 
who filed these lawsuits was disbarred seems to be 
incorrect. He was -- according to what I was told, 
he has only been disbarred for his greatly improper 
behavior, but -- and so he ~ one day he will, in 
fact, be practicing law again in South Florida ~ 


Page 123, 


Q Mr. Epstein, at any time before May 2005, did 
you receive a phone call from H.R. that she was bringin; 
Jane Doe 4 to your home so that Jane Doe 4 could give 
you a massage? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 
THE WITNESS: I'd like to answer that question, 
but unfortunately, I am going to have to answer 

that question as I've answered most of your 

questions here today, Mr. Horowitz, which is upon 

advice of counsel, they've told me I cannot answer 
your questions no matter how much I want to, They 
told me I have to assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth 

Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. 

Though you're currently suspended -- | keep 

saying "disbarred," but I'm not a lawyer, so I 

don't really understand the difference between 

disbarred and suspended ~ he seems to be only 

suspended by the Florida Bar, } -- I cannot answer 
that question today upon advice of counsel. 
BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q Okay. Sir, at any time before May 2005, did 
you instruct S.K. to place a telephone call to H.R., so 
that H.R. could arrange for Jane Doe 4 to come to your 
home for sexual activity with you? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 





Page 122 


MR. HOROWITZ: Okay. 

THE WITNESS: -- unlike Mr. Edwards’ parmer 
who currently sits in jail for perpetrating one of 
the largest frauds in South Florida's history. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ: 
Q Okay. I'm glad we got that squared away. 

Did you pay Jane Doe 4 to bring other minor 

girls to your home for your own sexual gratification? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

THE WITNESS: That question | believe would - 
is -- is -- [ would like to answer that question. 
Unfortunately, my counsel has advised me that I 
cannot answer any questions today that may become 
relevant to any of your lawsuits filed by you and 
your currently suspended partner, suspended by the 
Florida Bar, or answer questions relevant to Mr. 
Edwards who is sitting on your right, his firm's 
partner who's sitting in jail for fabricating cases 
of a sexual nature against people like me and 
others. 

I'd like to answer -- as you might imagine, I'd 
like to answer these questions, but I risk losing 
my counsel if you do so, so | must accept their 
advice today. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ:

your questions here today, Mr. Horowitz, which is

Though I'd like to answer the question, though I'm 
sure the jury will understand your partner has been 
suspended from practicing law in the State of 
Florida, Mr. Edwards’ partmer is in jail for 
fabricating cases of a sexual nature, so, though 
Td like to answer that question as your other 
questions today with specificity, my counsel has

MR. PIKE: Form. 
THE WITNESS: I'd like to answer every question 
that you posed here today, Mr. Horowitz, regarding 
any of your clients, and especially Miss Jane Doe 
5's claims. However, my attorneys have advised me 
that at least today, I must assert my rights under

resisted your sexual advances? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

THE WITNESS: It would give me great pleasure 
to be able to answer Jane Doe 5's claims. However, 
my attorneys have advised me today, at least today, 
that I must assert my rights under the Sixth -~ 
excuse me -- Fourteenth and Fifth Amendment. And, 
though I'd very much like to answer those 
questions, that question, and the other questions 
you've posed here today, I am going to have to 
assert those rights and respectfully decline.

Q Did you instruct $.K. to take Jane Doe 5's 
telephone number so you can call Jane Doe 5 to come to 
your home for more sexual activity? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 
THE WITNESS: I'd like to answer each one of 

your questions, these claims made by Jane Doe 5. 

However, today at least, my attorneys have advised 

me that I may not answer any questions that may be 

relevant to any of the lawsuits brought by you, 
your partner who's been suspended after he filed 

Miss Jane Doe 5's claim. He was suspended for 

improper behavior by the Florida Bar. | may not 

answer the questions of Mr. Edwards regarding his 
~- or his partner, Mr. Scott Rothstein, who was 
accused of the largest fraud by fabricating cases 

of 2 sexual nature of against people, me and 

others, in order to steal millions of dollars from 

unsuspecting people. So, although I would like to 

answer those questions, my attorneys have advised 
me that if I do so, | risk losing their 

representation and waiving my rights. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q After Jane Doe 5 visited your home, did you 
instruct S.K. to call Jane Doe 5 on the telephone to 
arrange for her to come back for more sexual activity? 


Page 196 


However, my attorneys have counseled me that ] may 
net. And if I choose to do so, contrary to their 
advice, 1 risk losing their representation and 

waiving those rights. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ: 

Q Okay. With respect to Jane Doe 5 and the 
questions that you have asserted your Fifth Amendment 
privilege, have you been asserting your Fifth Amendment} 
privilege to protect your innocence, or to conceal your 
guilt? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 
THE WITNESS: That's a question obviously 

designed to try to embarrass me. {i -- what -- I'd 

like to answer that question. However, my counsel 

has advised me that since your firm, your partner 

who was suspended for improper behavior since he 
filed this claim, Mr, Edwards’ partner who sits in 
jail, the Supreme Court has said that people can 
claim the Fifth Amendment, and should claim the 

Fifth Amendment who are innocent. 1 respectfully 

decline to answer, based on my counsel's advice, 

because they've told me if [ choose to answer, I 

may waive those rights, but I'd like to answer. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ: 
Q Sir, is there any reason you can think of as to 





Page 195 


MR. PIKE: Form. 

THE WITNESS: I'd like to answer each one of 
Miss Jane Doe S's claims. I'd like to answer each 
one with specificity, However, my attorneys have 
advised me today, that ] must assert my rights 
under the Fourteenth, Sixth and Fifth Amendment. 
And if I choose to answer, which is my preference, 
Trisk losing their representation and waiving 
those specific rights. 

BY MR. HOROWITZ: 
Q Isn't it true, sir, that you sexually abused 
Jane Doe 5 when she was a child? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

THE WITNESS: I'd very much like to answer that 
question, as I'd like to answer some of the others, 
that question in particular, it's been clear that 
your firm, your partner who's been suspended after 
filing such 2 claim of sexual abuse, Mr. Edwards’ 
partner who's in jail for probably the rest of his 
life, probably the rest of his life for filing just 
those types of claims, sexual abuse claims, and 
sexual claims of -- claims of a sexual! nature 
against people, me and others, to steal money, just 
-+ it's about money from people in South Florida, 
so I'd like to answer those questions today. 


Page 197 


why the jury should not infer from your testimony today 
that you did, in fact, sexually abuse Jane Doe 5 when 
she was a child? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

THE WITNESS: | believe the jury will be able 
to see what your firm, Mr. Edwards’ firm, and what 
the newspapers have referred to as part of the 
largest fraud in South Florida's history by 
crafting cases of a sexual nature against people 
like me and others, simply to get money. His 
partner sits in jail. Your partner has been 
suspended. I'd rather -- the jury will make its 
own decision. 

BY MR, HOROWITZ: 

Q > Great. The next individual }'d like to talk to 
you about is Jane Doe 6, and if you either write that 
down, or get that name in your head so that you remembe 
it when I ask you some questions about her, | would 
appreciate it, okay --

questions, Mr. Horowitz, today, I must respectfully 
decline to do so.

Q Did you instruct $.K. to communicate by

represented by the man who's currently sitting in

Florida's history, for creating fictitious, 4 

malicious cases of a sexual nature against wealthy 

people in order to steal money, steal money. The 

U.S. Attorney called E.W.'s attorneys a criminal

answer the claims of your -- Mr. Edwards' E.W. It 
would be nicer if Mr. ~ or I would appreciate it 
-- unfortunately -- but Mr, Edwards's partner who 
represented E,W. along with him is in jail for 
misrepresenting -- or the U.S. Attorney has called 
his firm a criminal enterprise, the one 
representing -- previously representing E.W. You 
represent Jane Doe 6. I'd like to answer her 
claims, but today my attorneys have counseled me 
that I must respectfully decline and assert my 
rights under the Fourteenth, Sixth and Fifth 
Amendment. 
BY MR. HOROWITZ: 
Q Did you inform S.K. that the massage that Jane 
Doe 6 was to give you would be sexual in nature? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 


THE WITNESS: Unfortunately, I] am going to have 


to respond to that question the way I've responded 
to most of your questions and claims here today 
regarding Jane Doe 6 and some of your other clients 
that you filed suits for, post filing the suit your 
partner was suspended by the Florida Bar, post 
filing the suit Mr. Edwards' partner finds himself 
in jail. 

Page 203 


So, though I'd very much like to answer those 
questions, my attorneys have counseled me today 
that I cannot answer, at least today, any questions 
relevant to these lawsuits. And if] decide or 
choose to answer the questions, I risk losing their 
representation and waiving those rights, Excuse 
me, Adam, five?

MR. PIKE: Before -- before you start another 
question there, I just want to be clear for the 
record that you said on the record that these 
questions that you had prepared were going to be

addressed by the Court, but, in fact, you've gone 
on with seven to eight questions, and all of which 
have been directly addressed by the Court, 

Now, I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I've 
unbuttoned my tie. I've -- my button -- I've

on?

entire night with you, okay? I've got places to

MR. HOROWITZ: Allright, Let me just get this} 1 
on the record. It's now 6:11 p.m. We've been 2 
working all day, as best we can, plowing through so 3 
far the claims of my seven clients, and though I 4 
have done my very best on my part to get through as 5 
much material as I can, I simply cannot finish 6 
today, number one, because we've already been 7 
working an eight-hour day, and two, maybe more 8 
importantly, [ have a plane to catch in about a 9 
Jittle bit over an hour. So with that said, I 10 
cannot complete today. You know, you can file what! 11 
you need to, and I'll file what J need to, but -- 12 

MR. EDWARDS: Well -- 13 

MR. HOROWITZ: Do you want to say anything?} 14 

MR. EDWARDS: Yeah. For the purposes of the} 15 
record, I'd just like to make the record in that 16 
the deposition was set in nine cases today, I 17 
believe. I was unable to ask any questions today, 18 
and I think the record is going to be clear as to 19 
the reason why that happened, both the video and 20 
the transcript, in a case like this where the 21 
options are answer questions, or take the Fifth, 22 
and the election for the most part was take the 23 


Fifth, it should be a short abbreviated 
deposition. Instead the types of answers that we 


Page 328 


to put that on the record, so that it's clear why 
we're not finishing, at least from my vantage 
point. 

MS. EZELL: And I'd to add that I had cross- 
noticed on behalf of our client in the one filed 
case we have. We also represent three other 
clients, and we do not yet have filed cases. We 
certainly want a chance to ask our questions as 
well. 1 do think we wasted a great deal of time 
today in very self-serving answers that did nothing 
to advance the discovery in this matter. 

MR. PIKE: Is everybody done? 

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. 

MR. EDWARDS: IH just join in on the comments 
by defense counsel. 

MR. PIKE: Okay. I'm just going to move to 
strike for purposes of the trial. I understand 
that everybody is trying to make a record for any 
future motion, but I move to strike everybody's 
comments for purpose -- purposes of the trial in 
this matter. 

We're here right now, Mr. Edwards, for you to 
begin and finish your deposition, We're here right 
now for you, Mrs. Ezell, to begin and finish your 
deposition of Mr. Epstein, And Mr, Horowitz, this 























































and cause us not to finish today. 






Page 327 




















received were obstructionist in nature. I think 1 
that that's -- that's going to be something that 2 
the Court is going to rule upon, but that’s going 3 
to be our position, And that after every -- nearly 4 
every question, there was some injection into the Ss 
record by Mr. Epstein about Jeffrey Herman and somq = 6 
discipline that he had with the Florida Bar, as 7” 
well as Scott Rothstein and his being in jail, as 8 
well as something to do with other partners going 9 
to jail, despite the fact that I haven't asked a 10 
single question, nor have any questions been asked 11 
about my clients, 12 

In addition to the mockery that was made of 13 
this deposition by Mr. Epstein and of the overall 14 
discovery process today because of the way he chose | 15 
to answer questions and that his counsel did not 16 
instruct him to do otherwise, and instead seemed to wy 
encourage those types of responses, we're unable to 18 
finish today. It's going to take another day. 19 

And one other thing that I think is going to be 20 
clear, but I want to put on the record, is that we 21 
probably took fifteen — no exaggeration -- breaks, 22 
each one of them initiated by Mr. Epstein, which 23 






just also served only to obstruct the deposition 
So I just want 








Page 329; 


case has been -- this deposition has been set for 

some time, and, you know, whether or not you have a 
flight plan, or whether or not it was prearranged, 

I do not know. But we are here right now to finish 
your deposition for your clients. So I see that 
everybody is standing, with the exception of 

Ms. Ezell. I'm sitting, and I'm ready to finish 

this deposition and let you guys commence, 

MS. EZELL: We've been going for eight hours 
and fifteen minutes, The facility we're in is all 
closed down. The lights are off everywhere. We 
can't get in and out of doors, I think to suggest 
we proceed for what would be another eight hours at 
this point is just not workable. 

MR. EDWARDS: And I probably have five hours of 
questions, and that's assuming that the answers 
that we receive were less elongated than the ones 
we received already. So given the circumstances 
and the nature of the responses and how Jong it 
takes to respond, we would not finish until next 
Thursday at this pace so J just don't think it 
would be fruitful to continue. 

MR. PIKE: I understand your statement. 
MR. EDWARDS: Right. 
MR. PIKE: The facility here we have arranged

to have it after hours, Our particular area is -- 
is -- area is not closed down, so if you'd like to 
go forth with the deposition, we are here, as I've 
said. 

MR. HOROWITZ: Let me say this. You know, nv 
-~ nearly all of my clients have had two days of 
depositions, despite the fact that they're parties 
to only one case. Mr. Epstein is a party to a 
dozen cases just for ~ on the lawyers who are here 
today. So given the practice of parties’ appearing 
for two days of depositions in the past, it makes 
sense particularly in the case of Mr. Epstein who's 
a party in multiple cases to do at least two days 
of depositions for the same reasons. There's just 
a lot of material to cover. 

MR. PIKE: I think everybody has said their 
piece, 

MR. EDWARDS: Yep. 

MR. PIKE: Are we going off the record? 

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes, we can go off the record.

engaging in sex acts with these young girls? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: No, I don't know. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. No one ever told you that? 

A. No. 

Q. Well, since you've been keeping up with 
what's been written in the newspapers, at some 
point in time you've read that Nadia Marcenacova 
joined in some of these sex acts with some of 
these girls. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: I believe so. 
BY MR, EDWARDS: 

Q. I'm not the first person telling you 
that?

MR. CRITTON: Form.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 


Page 243 
Q. Were you surprised when the story started

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS:

sure 100 percent that -- weil, let me say it this

Q. Skipping to the second paragraph 


WONAUAWHe 


Page 244 fi 
page 72, Rodriguez stated the amount of girls that [i 
came to the house was approximately 15. 
That's the estimate that you gave back -- 

A. All the girls that I saw coming in and 
out. 

Q. Weil, when I read this, you can tell me 
what it actually means, when I read this T 
interpreted that as because they were talking 
about masseuses I interpreted that as the number 
of girls of the Palm Beach area that came over and 
you labeled masseuses. Is that correct? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. Could you name ~Imean,I know ff 
that we've named T. and C., could you name any of 
the other -- 

A. C. comes all the time, you know, I 
remember her. 

Q. Okay. No other names pop out though? 

A. To be honest with you, no. 

Q. A? 

A. Yeah, because I remember because the car. 

Q. Allright. It goes on to say, when asked 
to identify these girls, so somebody else asked 


Page 245 E 
you the same question I just did, Rodriguez stated 
he could not at the moment but knew he wrote their [ 


with Mr. Epstein. Is that true? 

A. Yes. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Did you ever find that journal? 

A. Probably has some pages at home. 

Q. Because later on it seems like you met up 
with the police officer and produced a green 
folder that contained documents, but that's not 
the same thing as the journal. Right? 

A. No, this is my writings. 

Q. Okay. So if we want to obtain that 
journal from you what's the best way to go about 
getting It? 

A. I probably have to look In my house. 

Q. Okay, Well, it looks like we're going to 
come back for a second part of this, so by next 
time maybe you could find it. Right? 

A. Okay. 

Q. Allright. Mr. Mermelstein asked you if t 
anybody had contacted you about this case that was 
either an -- that was an investigator with Mr.

7115 Rue Notre Dame, Miami Beach, FL 33141 


WONANAWNHE 


Page 222 
Epstein's investigators that you felt there was 
more going on in the bedroom than just massages? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Because they were more 
interested in how much I know, they didn’t 
ask me anything else, and I told them 
exactly what I knew and what I was doing. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. You were asked by Mr. Mermelstein 
when he was asking you about the meeting with Mr. 
Epstein's investigators he said, did they make any 
threat or did they threaten you, and you paused 
and said I don’t believe so. 

A. Yeah, I think they didn't tell me 
anything that I will feel -- they told me that 
they want to know what I know and if I need an 
attorney. 

Q. Okay. Did you find that strange at ail 
that they offered you an attorney? 

A. Lwent to have dinner at my house and I 
told this to my wife and she told me, Alfredo, you 
don't need an attorney, so I called him the next 
day ‘and that was it. 

Q. You called the investigators? 

A. Yes. I declined, I don't need an 


Page 223 
attorney. 

Q. If we want to know the exact names of the 
investigators that you met at Don Shula's and at 
your house, how would we get that information, do 
you have it somewhere? 

A. Probably I have it in the house. 

Q. So if we do have to come back here and 
finish this up, the next time would you be able to 
bring that? 

A. I think so, 

Q. Okay. Do you know where in your house 
that you have it, I mean, have you kept it In a 
certain place? 

A. Thave to look. 

Q. Allright. After the sentence that we 
left off it says, he, speaking of Mr. Rodriguez, 
would clean Mr, Epstein's bedroom after the 
alleged massages and would discover massagers 
slash vibrators and sex toys scattered on the 
floor. 

Can you tell us what types of sex toys 
that you found scattered on the floor after the 
massages with these young girls? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Like I explain, there was a 


Page 224 ff 
massage with a handle with two rubber things — 
that you can do massage yourself, this was 
always on the floor, maybe one or two. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. When you say this Is always on the 
floor, do you mean 24 hours a day it's on the 
floor? 

A. No, no, no, after each massage. Because 
Tassume the masseuses or anybody they were doing, 
they were taken out of the closet wherever they 
belong and they would leave there. So Louella and 
myself, we always find this on the floor. 

Q. And this is a massager that belongs to or 
is owned by Mr. Epstein? 

A. Yes. 

Q. This isn't something that these girls 
would bring over to the house? 

A, No, no, it’s in the house, it's part of 
the inventory. 

Q. And that statement is a few statements 
after you felt that there was a lot more going on 
than just massages, is there something about that 
object being left on the ground and the type of 
object that it was that also lead you to believe 
that there is something more going on here than 


just massages? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Yes. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: ‘ 
Q. What about it, just tell us? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: I thought they were having 
a good time, I never thought it was 
something done against anybody's will, but 
of course, you know that it’s more than 
massage. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Right, I'm just asking you to explain how 
you know that. 

MR. CRITTON: Let me just move to strike 
his last answer as speculation. Form as to 
your statement. 

THE WITNESS: You're 50 years old and 
it's -~ you're an old -- you know, it's just 
instinct. 

MR. CRITTON: Move to strike. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. It was obvious to you? 
A. Yes. 
MR. CRITTON: Form.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. He also said he would wipe down the 
vibrators and sex toys and put them away in the 
armoire, 

MR. CRITTON: Form, 

THE WITNESS: These things have a tip, 
they have the cream, they have all kinds of 
cream for giving massage. 

BY MR, EDWARDS: 

Q. How many of these massagers or vibrators 
11. would you wipe down? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: This big one all the time. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Right. Other than the big one all the 
time did you wipe down at any time any of the 
other sex toys or vibrators? 

A, No. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. So if there were any other sex toys or 
vibrators or I believe you used the term dildo 
earlier that were ever used, those are items that 
you did not find on the floor and were put away in 
the armoire?

i MR. CRITTON: Form. 
2 THE WITNESS: Louella told me I did this, 
3 I did that. 
4 BY MR, EDWARDS: 
5 Q. So tell us what did Louella tell you? 
6 A. She find toys on the floors, she have to 
7 dean them, 
8 Q. Did she tell you when she found the toys 
9 on the floor? 

A. After his massages, you know. 
11 Q. With the young girls that we're talking 
about? 

A. Yes. 

Q, Okay. And when did Louella tell you 
that? 

A. Almost every other time when she found 
it, you know, Affredo I found this thing again 
because she despised to clean this, she had to put 
the gloves or whatever, 

Q. Okay. So it sounds like you had an 
actual conversation about this where she's 
describing she doesn't want to clean it. 

A. Because I told her to tell me up to date 
on things that are not normal, so she told me, you 
acai I found this, I found that, or some 














Page 226 


Page 227 






























Page 228 fF 
underwear she brought it to the laundry and we 
used to label it. 

Q. Just so that the record is clear as to 
what we're talking about with this and that, I 
want you to tell us what Louella would tell you 
specificaily, I found this and then would she show 
you what it was? 

A. No, she didn't show me, she said 1 
cleaned this and I put it away, it was a vibrator. 

Q. Did she describe the vibrator for you so 
that you knew which one she was talking about? 
12 A. The vibrator that a female would use for 
personal use. 

Q. Not the same long one that you've been 
describing? 

16 A. No. 
Q. One that is a penis shaped vibrator. 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR, EDWARDS: 

Q. That's what she was talking about? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And did she tell you on how many 
occasions after these -- 

A. Several times, 


WONANARWNE 


Page 229 
‘LD Q. And can you explain to us why it is that 
2. -- and maybe it's just I don't understand the 
3 process of cleaning the room who went in first and 
4 second and whatever, but my question is why is it 
5 that she would always be the one to encounter the 
6 penis shaped vibrators and you would encounter 
7 this other longer vibrator? 
8 MR. CRITTON: Form. 
9 THE WITNESS: Because it was her job to 
clean the room. When she was busy she will 
ask me, Alfredo, can you help me carry, I 
have a lot of towels, because there were

Q. Did she teil you why? 

A. Because, you know, she knew what they 
were for and probably she despised to clean 
objects. 

Q. Did she ever make any comments about how 
young the girls were that were in the room with 
Mr. Epstein just before she had to go in and clean 
these vibrators? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Is the age of the girls that were coming 
over and going behind closed doors with Mr. 

Epstein a subject that ever came up between you 
and Louella? 

A. Sometimes. 

Q. And what would the conversation consist 


A. She will be surprised and say some of the 
girls are too young, and I said -- we just wonder, 
you know, but we comment each other. 

Q. Did it ever -- as a father did it ever 
occur to you that maybe I should say something or 
I shouldn't be here or I shouldn't be apart of 
this considering how young they are and how old he

a lack of respect. So, you know, she was. 
shocked. So obviously she needed a job but 
she expressed her -- 

MR. WILLITS: I'm sorry, I did not hear 
that, could the witness repeat that? 

THE WITNESS: I was just talking about 
Louella, deeply religious staff member that 
worked with me and she told me one occasion 
that she was crying because the picture of 
the Pope was next to a naked girl. 

MR. WILLITS: Okay. 

BY MR, EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. Besides Louella did you ever have 
a conversation with anybody else that works in the 
house about the young age of the girls and Mr. 
Epstein being in the bedroom and the fact that 
there are sex toys on the floor afterwards being 
wrong? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Nobody else inside the 
house was allowed except just the two of us, 
so I never commented on this with anybody. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Allright. The next sentence starts a 
new paragraph, Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to |; 





is? 
MR. CRITTON: Form, 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Is that something that on more than one 
occasion you thought to yourself this is just 
wrong?. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And did you ever have a conversation with 
Louella about the fact that that's not right? 

A. We had. 

Q. And Louella stayed there and she's still 
employed there? 

A. I believe she was. 

Q. And did she ever mention to you that she 
thought that the situation was wrong and that she 
was contemplating -- 

A. She was a deeply religious -- 

MR. CRITTON: Form to the last question. 
THE WITNESS: -- Catholic Filipino girt 
~~ lady, and one day she came crying because 
she found a picture of the Pope next to 


naked girl, both pictures, and she said it's 


Page 233 
the Dollar Rent a Car and rent a car for the same 
girl he brought the roses to. 
I guess we're talking about A. 
So that she could drive herself to 
Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said 
the girl always needed rides to and from the 
house. 
Are those statements you agree with? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: I took her a few times to 
her house. 
BY MR, EDWARDS: 
Q. You took A. to and from her house? 
A. In Royal Paim Beach. 
Q. Okay. Did she say anything in the car to 
you about what was going on in the bedroom with 
Mr. Epstein? 
A. Lalways try to keep the conversation to : 
@ minimum when I was with them because it was my 
job, you know, I didn't want to talk so the 
conversation was minimal. 
Q. And these are girs that you're talking 
to that are roughly the same age as a daughter 
that you have?

divulging any secrets here, right? 
MR. PIKE: Move to strike. 

Q That's the question that's pending, 

A. | would like to answer that question as 
well, as all your other questions today, however, | 
Thave to follow my attorneys’ advice. They have! 
told me I must invoke my Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment right to not answer those 
questions today, or any questions relevant to 
this lawsuit, so accordingly, I'm going to assert 
those rights and -- under the constitution 
guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth, and Fourteenti 
amendment. 

Q Would you consider yourself addicted to 
sex with minor females? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A’ You know, Mr. Edwards, again, I want to 
be very respectful. As the current U.S. Attorney 
has described your law firm as a criminal 
enterprise and part of one of the largest frauds 
in Florida's history, it has been reported that 
your firm has fabricated multiple cases against 
ime in order to fleece unsuspecting investors out 
of millions and millions of dollars, so 
unfortunately at this time, although I would like 

7 


to answer that question, on advice of counsel f 
will have to reftain and assert my Fifth, Sixth 
and Fourteenth Amendment right, 

Q Can you then provide an explanation for 
what relevance that soliloquy of yours has to, 
whether or not you engaged in sex acts with L.M. 
When she was a minor? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, no, he cannot. 
Argumentative. Compound, harassing, 

MR. EDWARDS: Mr. Pike, with all due 
respect, it was not my idea for him to give 
this speech about a former RRA law firm I 
was asking to elaborate on that. 

MR. PIKE: Counsel, I'm working with 
your follow-up question. 

MR. EDWARDS: J understand. 

MR. PIKE: I'm objecting, object to the 
form and stating the reasons on the record 
why the form is required to be objected to, 
based upon your question. 

MR. EDWARDS: Will he elaborate on the 
relevance of that soliloquy to kis touching 
L.M. when she was 13, 14 and 15 years old in 
asexual manner? 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to object again, 





argumentative, compound, harassing and 

irrelevant. 

Q You can answer. 

A_ I would like to answer, however, I'm 
going to have to assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth 
Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment right as advise: 
by my counsel, otherwise I risk losing their 
advice. 

Q Mr, Epstein, have you ever been 
diagnosed with a sex addiction te minors by a 
psychologist or other medical professional? 

A_ intend to respond to all of your 
questions at some relevant time; however, today 
at the present time, my attorneys have counseled 
me that I cannot provide answers to any questions 
relevant to this lawsuit and { must accept their 
advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment rights 
to effective representation. 

Accordingly, I assert my Fifth, 
Federal -» Fifth and Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendment rights, to the United States 
Constitution, 

MR. PIKE: In addition to that, Mr. 

Edwards, as the Court has ruled on several 

matters, Mr. Epstein’s medical history is 


not relevant at this time nor has he placed 

same at issue in this case. 

MR. EDWARDS: Understood. 

Q Mr. Epstein, were you sexually abused as 
aminor? 

A Again? 

Q Were you sexually abused, as a minor? 

A You know, again, I would like to respond 
to all -- if any questions seem to be relevant, 

T would like to respond to any relevant question 
at this time; however, my attorneys have 
counseled me that 1 cannot provide answers to the 
questions relevant to this lawsuit today. I must 
accept their advice or risk losing my Sixth 
Amendment right to effective representation. 
Accordingly then, J assert my Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment right to the United States 
Constitution. 

Q isn't it true that you have engaged in 
some sexual interaction with hundreds of undera: 
prinor femates in the last ten years of your 
life? Es that true? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, relevance. 

A Mr. Edwards, the current U.S. Attorney 

has described your law firm as a criminal 


3 (Pages 6 to 9}

10] 


enterprise and part of the largest fraud in 
Florida's history. It has been reported that 
your firm fabricated multiple cases, many, many 
multiple cases against me in order to fleece 
unsuspecting investors out of millions and 
millions of dollars. Unfortunately, at this time 
in response to your question, my attorneys have 
advised me that I must assert my Sixth Amendment, 
Fifth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment right, 
Though, I betieve, you know, that I would really 
like to answer your questions today, but at this 
moment I must assert those rights or risk having 
my attorneys resign. 

Q You're invoking your Fifth Amendment 
rights to each of these questions because you 


know your answers will incriminate you and you. 


feel it will result in you being prosecuted for 
your crimes; isn't that right? 
MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
harassing, Calls for a legal conclusion. 

Q You can answer. 

A No, in fact, the Supreme Court recently 
said the Fifth Amendment right is there to 
protect the innocent, so, that's the way 1 would 
like to answer that. 


LL 


Q Are you actually telling the jary that 
you didn’t commit the crimes that have been 
alleged against you by the various females that 
were under age when you engaged in sex with 
them? Are you telling the jury that right now? 
MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 

harassing, 

A_ I would like to respond to that 
question, as you know, however, at the present 
time my attorneys have counseled me that I cannot 
provide answers to any questions relevant to this 
lawsuit and I must accept their advice or risk 
losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation. Accordingly, I assert my Fifth, 
Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right under the 
United States Constitution. 

Q Mr. Epstein, you understand that this is 
the video that will be played to the jury in 
1L.M.'s trial against you and LM, wants answers. 
The jury is going to want answers, se I know that 
you're felling us that you're going to respond at 
some time in the future; but the time is now. 
Would you like this opportunity te explain why 
you engaged in sexual activity with L.M. 
beginning when she was 13 years old and you we

50 years old? 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to object once 
again. We are getting way too argumentative 
with the questioning. The questioning is 
compound. It is speculative and it is also 
harassing. Whether or not this deposition 
video, thereof is played in front of a jury 
is a question of fact, and it will be 
determined by a judge pursuant to a motion 
in timine, various portions thereof may or 
may not be played, so having placed those 
objections on the record I'm going to 
instruct Mr. Epstein not to answer that 
question, 

MR. EDWARDS: Mr. Pike, I don't know i 
you watched the 13 hours of harassing 
questions to L.M., that she sometimes 
invoked her Fifth Amendment rights, I 
understand the adverse advice that would be 
given and she was made to answer these 
questions and these exact same questions 
were asked of her, in fact, I'm using the 
phraseology from Mr. Luttier, I'm not 
trying to harass him, 

Q Pm simply asking him to explain to the 


13 






















jury. If you're saying it didn't happen, if 
you're saying it did happen, explain to the ju 
why you did it. That's all I want te hear. I'm 
being respectful about this. 

MR, PIKE: In an effort to keep a clean 
record be respectful to the to the court 
reporter rather than having a diatribe back 
and forth between you and myself, I'll move 
to strike your Jast statement as 
irrelevant. Let's move on. 

Q Isit true, Mr. Epstein, you were born 
January 20, 19537 
Yes. 
Where? 
New York, 
Where in New York? 
Brooklyn. 
Did you go to high school there?

i 
relevant to this lawsuit, so accordingly I assert | 
i 


my constitutional rights as guaranteed by the 
Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Are you invoking your Fifth Amendment 
rights as to why you left college, is it safe 
then to presume that that answer you believe 
would incriminate you in some way? 


MR. PIKE: I'm going to move to strike, | 


speculative, argumentative, harassing, 


Calis for a legat conclusion, and 1 know 
exactly what you're trying to do here, Mr. 
Edwards, is lace the record with questions 
that would ultimately give you an adverse 
inference at any potential trial of this 
matter, so having put that on the record, 

I'm going to instruct him not to answer that 

question, based upon his Fifth, Sixth and 

Fourteenth Amendment rights to the United 

States Constitution, 

MR. EDWARDS: With all due respect you | 
cannot invoke his Fifth Amendment rights, | 
your attorneys instructed me in that fact -- | 

MR. PIKE: He can, i 

MR. EDWARDS: That L.M. Hadtodoit — | 
herself, so, I would like to hear it from | 
Mr, Epstein, 

Q Cam we assume you're invoking your Fifth:

early, that that answer you feel would 
ineriminate you? 


MR, PIKE: Once again, move to strike i 


for the same reasons. 
You can answer, 
A. I've already answered the question. 





SAAR RWNE 








I'll restate the answer. { would like to 
respond, intend to respond, and would like to 
respond to all questions today. However, counsel 
has advised me ] must take the Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment right under the U.S. 
Constitution, 

Q After college where were you employed? 

A You know, I would like to respond to all 
your questions today, however, on advice of 
counsel, I intend to take the Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights provided by the 
United States Constitution or risk losing my 
counsel's representation. 

Q Isn't it true that you were a teacher at 
the Dalton School in New York after college? 

A Again, I would like to respond to all 
your questions; however, my attorneys have 
counseled me that I cannot provide answers to any| 
questions today regarding to this lawsuit so I 
must accept their advice or risk losing my Sixth 
Amendment right to effective representation. 
Accordingly, I assert my Constitutional rights as 
guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendment of the constitution. 

Q Mr. Epstein, did you have sex with any 


17 


underage students while teaching at the Dalton 
Scheol? i 

A. Could you repeat that? 

Q Yes. Did you have sex with any underage 
students while teaching at the Dalton School in 
New York? 

A Mr, Edwards, your firm has been 
described by the U.S. Attorney as one of the 
largest -- as a criminal enterprise, perpetrating 
one of the largest frauds in Florida's history, 

It has been reported that your firm fabricated 
multiple cases against me and others in order to 
fleece unsuspecting investors out of millions and 
millions of dollars. 

Unfortunately at this time in response 
to your question, my attorneys have advised me I 
must assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment 
and Fourteenth Amendment rights, though I believe 
you know [ would like -- really like to answer 
your questions but at this time ] must assert 
those rights or have my attorneys resign. 

MR. EDWARDS: Mr. Pike, I think you know 

he has a couple of options here. He can 
answer questions or he can invoke his Fifth 
Amendment rights. This nonresponsive

OOH WHE 


as 





verbiage regarding the RRA law firm is not 
one of the options, it's inappropriate in 
the deposition and I would ask you to 
instruct your client not to obstruct this 
process any further. I am not going to 
terminate the deposition, F want it to 
finish, but obviously this is going to be 
the subject matter of some motion in the 
courts and you know the judges will not 
appreciate this. I would like to just move 
this process along by eliminating that 
portion of his answer. I understand what he 
is saying. I get it, but that's not 
something responsive to any of the questions 
and I think you know it is inappropriate. 
MR. PIKE: I think the deponent is 
answering the questions. If you believe the 
responses are inappropriate and feel you can 
take it up with the Court with the motion 
you are speaking of, as you've done then you 
can, as you've done several times before. 
Q After leaving the Dalton School, Is it 





true that you began working as a money manager at 


Bear Stearns? 
A intend to respond to all your 





questions regarding this lawsuit at some relevant 
time, however, at the present time my attomeys 

have counseled me that I cannot provide answers 

to any questions relevant to this lawsuit. Since 

the U.S. Attorney has described your law firm as 

a criminal enterprise, Mr. Edwards, and a part of 

the largest fraud in Florida's history, 1am 

going to assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth 
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights to the 
U.S. Constitution, 

Q Isn't it true that while you were 
working at Bear Stearns you were already engagi 
in sex with underage minors? 

A. Again, { believe you know the answers to 
those questions, but -~ 

Q Yes. 

A May I finish? 

Q Ido. 

MR. PIKE: Move to strike. Let the 
witness —- 

Q Sure-- 

MR. PIKE: Let the witness answer your 
question. 

MR. EDWARDS: I wouid love for him to 
finish the questions.

I don't want the adverse inferences. 

MR. PIKE: Having said that, please

question, 

A_ Car you please repeat the question? 

Q Isn't it true while working at Bear 
Stearns you were already engaging in sex with 
underage minor females?

U.S. Attomey, as a criminal enterprise, using 
some of the cases fabricated against me, 
personally, I would like to answer that question 
today; however, upon advice of counsel 1 must 
assert my Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment]

risk losing their representation: 









Q Atsome point in time while at Bear 
Stearns you met and managed the money for a 
fellow named Leslie Wexler, correct? 

A Again, 1 would like to answer all 
questions relevant to this lawsuit, but today I 
must assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment 
and Fourteenth Amendment right to the U.S. 
Constitution. 

Q In fact, I read in another deposition of 
yours that you do not consider yourself to be 
homosexual, correct? 

A_ (No response.) 

Q You've answered that question before, 
correct? 

A Correct. 

Q Do you consider yourself to be 
bisexual? 

A No. 

Q Inany event, you did develop a sexual 
relationship with Leslie Wexler at seme point in 
time; is that true? 

A No. 

Q Did you have a business relationship 
with Mr. Wexler?

especially since your firm has been described by 
the United States Attorney in South Florida as a 
criminal enterprise purported to -- purported to 
have put -- pulled off the largest fraud in 

Florida's history, I would like to answer it, 
however, my attorneys here today counseled me T 
must assert my Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendment right under the U.S, Constitution, 
therefore I'm going to do that. 

Q Are you saying because Rothstein, 
Rosenfeld, Adier was determined to be a criminal 
enterprise or somebedy was running a criminal 
enterprise out of that law firm, that is the 
reason why you are not going to answer these 
questions teday? You linked that together in 
that answer. I just want to make sure I'm 
understanding that right? 

A_ I'm going to take the Fifth -- ] intend 1 
to respond fo all relevant questions today, { 
would fike to respond; unfortunately my attorneys 
have counseled me I can't, | must assert my 
Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights } 
under the U.S, Constitution. | 





Q Because other law firms have asked very 
similar questions and you haven't responded td 
any of theirs either. I just want to understand ; 
what the relationship between Rothstein, 
Rosenfeld, Adler is to you invoking your Fifth 
Amendment rights today, if you can articulate 
that for me. 
MR. PIKE: Form, compound, 

argumentative. 

A Rothstein, Rosenfeld, Adier has been 
described by the U.S. Attorney as a criminal 
enterprise and as part of the largest fraud in 
Florida's history, It has been reported that 
your firm fabricated multiple cases using me, and. 
against me in order to fleece unsuspecting i 
investors out of millions of dollars. |

MR. PIKE: Overbroad. Speculation, 
argumentative, compound, harassing end 
confusing as well; as worded. Do you want 
to break it down, Mr. Edwards? 

Q Isn't it true that for the past ten 
years you have found a way to engage in sexual 
conduct with underage minors on an every day 
basis? 
MR. PIKE: Speculation, Argumentative, 
A. As your firm bas been described as a 
criminal enterprise by the United States Attorney

Q Just for the record, E can ouly spell it

your airplane. I don’t know exactly how she 
spells her name, only how your pilot would spell 
her name. 

MR. PIKE: Form, speculating. 

Q If] misspell it -- 

MR. PIKE: Form, speculation, 
argumentative, harassing. 

MR. EDWARDS: That's harassing? 

MR. PIKE; It assumes facts currently 
not in evidence in this particular 
deposition; therefore, I move to strike. 

MR. EDWARDS: I was responding to his 
question asking me how to spell her name. { 
don't know how other than his own pilot. 

MR. PIKE: Mr. Edwards, he asked you to 
spell the name, you then spelled the name, 
then went on with another narrative and 
there wasn't a question posed, on the floor. 

Q You would agree you interacted with V.

every day in a sexual way, when she was 15 years 
old, right? 

A Again, I'm sorry? 

Q Sure. You would agree that you 
interacted with V.R. sexually on an every day 
basis when she was 15 years old? 

A. You know, again, Mr. Edwards, 1 would 
like to answer all your questions here today. My 
attorneys have asked me -- advised me that 1 must 


assert my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Aaah 10 


aad Fifth Amendment rights provided by the U.S. 
Constitution and the fact that the current U.S, 
Attorney has described your law firm as a 
criminal enterprise, is one of the largest frauds 

in Florida's history for fabricating sexual -- 

cases of a sexual nature against me and others. 
Unfortunately, although | would like to answer 
those questions, if I do I risk losing my 

attorneys’ counsel. Therefore, I must assert my 
right. 

MR. EDWARDS: Madam court reporter, I'll 
attach as an exhibit, the Jane Doe number 
102 versus Jeffrey Epstein complaint, at 
some point in time. It will be Exhibit 1, 
as I'm going to go through some of the facts 

35 
as alleged in the complaint and as will be 
testified to by the plaintiff. 

(Jane Doe number 102 versus Jeffrey 
Epstein complaint was deemed marked as 
Exhibit number 1 for identification, as of 
this date.) 

MR. PIKE: Counsel, do you have an extra 
copy of that for me? 

MR. EDWARDS: No. 

MR. PIKE: May I fook at it real quick? 

MR. EDWARDS: No. It has my notes on

MR. EDWARDS: The notes are highlighted 
so when we copy it, it will not show up. | 
MR. PIKE: Just for the record, that's 2 | 
current, operative pleading, correct? 

MR. EDWARDS: Correct. 

‘THE WITNESS: What does that mean? 

MR. PIKE: There may have been some 
amendments to a complaint and I want to make

THE VIDEOGRAPHER; Off the video recor: 

12:01 p.m. 

(Pause in the proceedings.) 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the 

video record at 12:02 p.m. 

Q Is it true, Mr. Epstein, that you and 
Ghislaine Maxwell forced V.R. to have sex with 
you on a daily basis? 

MR. PIKE; Form, argumentative, 

harassing, 

A Unfortunately at this time, though T 
would really like to answer those questions, and 
like I have done for most of your questions here 
today, Mr. Edwards, your firm was described as a 
ctiminal enterprise, a serious criminal 
enterprise by the current U.S. Attorney. Part of 
that criminal enterprise was fabricating cases of 

37 


a sexual nature against me and others in order to 
fleece unsuspecting investors out of millions of 
dollars. Though, unfortunately at this time no 
matter how E would like to respond to your 
questions, I must assert my Sixth Amendment, 
Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right 
under the U.S. Constitution or risk having my 
attorneys resign. 

Q Isn't it true that V.R. was yours and 
Ghistaine Maxwell's sex slave from the time she 
was 15 through the time she escaped when she w 
19? 

MR. PIKE: Again objection, 

argumentative, harassing. 

A Mr. Edwards, your firm has been 
described as -- excuse me, as a criminal 
enterprise by the current U.S. Atomey and part 
of the largest fraud in Florida's history. Part 
of that fraud was fabricating multiple cases 
against people like me and others, of a sexual 
nature, in order to fleece unsuspecting investors 
out of millions and millions of dollars, so 
though I would like to answer that question, my 
attorneys have told me today I must assert my 
Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment and Fi: 


10 (Pages 34 to 37) 





U.S. Legal Support 
(561) 835-0220 


Amendment right. 

Q Isn't it true that you and Ghislaine 
Maxwell celebrated her 16th birthday with her ani 
had sex with her on that day? 

MR, PIKE: Form. Compound, confusing, 
argumentative, harassing. 

A Mr. Edwards, I would like to answer that 
question. My attorneys have told me today, I 
have to at least today assert my Fifth Amendment, 
Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights 
fo the U.S. Constitution, especially my concern 
is, that your firm has filed fraudulent lawsuits, 
fabricated lawsuits, and the U.S. Attorney, the 
current U.S. Attorney has described your firm as 
a criminal enterprise that ~ whose main purpose 
was to generate money for the firm and its 
co-conspirators through the operation of various 
criminal activities, including mail fraud, wire 
fraud and money laundering. 

Q Are you saying that the complaint of 
L.M. against you, the allegation in that 
complaint, are false? 

MR. PIKE: Form, Misinterprets the 
witness's testimony, 


Q Or saying it is true? 


MR, PIKE: Same objection, 
Q Its either true or false? 
A I'lbrepeat myself, unfortunately, but 
the current U.S. Attorney has described your law 
firm that filed that filed L.M.'s claim -- was 
involved in the filing of L.M.'s claim, 
motions -- I'm sorry, do you want to tefl me what 





it was then? Would you like to tell me the 
firm's involvement in this lawsuit, since we will 
be here the rest of the day? 

Q Answer the question. 

A. Allright. 

The U.S. Attorney has described that 

firm as a criminal enterprise perpetrating one of 
the largest frauds in Florida's history against 
unsuspecting investors, fleecing them out of 
millions of dollars by creating, crafting and 
fabricating fellacious (sic) sexual claims 
against people like me and others, so 
unfortunately, though I would like to answer your 
questions, Mr. Edwards, my counsel has advised me) 
that at least today I must assert my Sixth 
Amendment, Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. 

Q Isn't it true, sir, and i'm reading from 


21 
22 
an 
24 
25 


40 


the complaint filed by V.R. against you, isn’t it 
true, sir, that a friend of yours sent you three, 
12-year old femates for you to sexually abuse on 
one of your birthdays? 

MR. PIKE: Form, argumentative, 

harassing, and irrelevant to this lawsuit. 

THE WITNESS: Excuse me. 

A You're saying it is part of the 
Jawsuit? 
Q Yes, ('8 read it. 

“On one of the defendant Epstein’s 
birthdays, a friend of defendant Epstein sent him 
three, 12-year ofd girls from France who spoke nq 
English for defendant to sexually exploit and 
abuse? After doing so they were sent back to 
France the next day.” 

Isn't that true? 

MR. PIKE: Once again, move to strike, 

irrelevant, argumentative, harassing, and 
for the record, the exhibit that's being 
read from is a complaint that's unrelated to 
the instant matter and not filed or 
incorporated by the current plaintiff, L.M., 
in this matter. 

A_ I would like to answer that question, I 


really would; however, today my attorneys have 
told me I have to assert my Fifth Amendment, 
Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right 
of the U.S. Constitution, especially because your 
firm involved in this lawsuit has fabricated, 
widely reported, multiple cases of sexual 
harassment cases against individuals like me and 
others, perpetrating what the U.S. Attorney 
called one of the largest frauds in Florida's 
history, fleecing people out of millions of 
dojlars, so though I would like to answer that 
question, today I have to assert those rights or 
tisk fosing my attorneys' counsel, 

Q Isn't it true that you forced V.R. as a 
15-year old girl to have sex with numerous 
friends of yours? 

A Are you kidding? 

Q Reading from a lawsuit. 

A Sorry, Mr. Edwards. Though I would like 
to answer that question as well, as I've answered 
most of your other questions here today, I would 
like to respond; however, my attorneys here today 
have advised me | have to assert my Fifth

occurring.

asked and answered. 

4 As your firm, Mr. Edwards and Mr. 
Jaffe’s has been described by the U.S. Attorney 
as perpetrating one of the largest frauds in I 
South Florida's history by crafting malicious 
cases of a sexual nature against people like me 
and others, in order to fleece, using bogus 
schemes, in the U.S. Attorney's words, investment 
schemes. Unfortunately, though I would like to | 
answer every one of your questions if I'm able, 
my attorneys have advised me I must assert my | 
Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment and Fifth 
Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. 
Therefore, at the moment I cannot answer that 
question, 

Q The acts related to your guilty plea 
occurred at your Palm Beach house; is that 
correct? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Again, sorry. 

Q Ifyou were soliciting prostitutes, it 
wasn't out on the street, it wasn't at a hotel. 
These were girls that you solicited to be 
prostitutes at your house in Palm Beach, 
correct?

MR. PIKE: Objection, relevance, 
argumentative, Calls for speculation as

question, my attorneys today have advised me I 
cannot answer you today, and they've advised me I 
must assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment 
and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S, 
Constitution. Otherwise I risk losing their 
representation. So, accordingly I must assert 
those rights, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. Jaffe. 
Q In what county did you plead guilty to 
these felony offenses? 
A Palm Beach County.

Palm Beach County?

9 A I'm saying I pled guilty to the

il Q Right, and you would certainly agree 
12 that that would require yourself and one other 
13 individual for that act of prostitution, 
14 correct? 
15 MR. PIKE: Form. Also calls for a legal 
16 conclusion. 
17 A I pled guilty to solicitation of 
18 prostitution. 
19 Q@ Are you saying that those females that 
20 were the victims, at least listed as victims by

9 prostitution. 


10 Q Are you saying now that the subjects of 
11 that, which were called victims, were not 

12 underage when you engaged in sex with them?| 
13 MR. PIKE: Form, argumentative, 

14 speculation, assumes facts not in evidence, 

15 as well as mischaracterizes the witness's 

16 testimony. 

17 A I pled guilty to solicitation of 

18 prostitution, not underage prostitution, 

19 solicitation of prostitution.

interactions with that minor? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections.

Q The charge is procuring a minor. You 
tell me. Who was that minor? 

A I don't know. 

Q You were never told during the State 
Attorney's prosecution of yor, whe this person

A No, 

Q Why did you plead guilty to a felony 
charge that resulted in you going te jail, 
without even knowing who the victim was? 

MR. PIKE: Form. That question calls 

for attorney/client information, and 

therefore, I'm going to instruct him not to 

answer that. 

Q [fit has anything to do with any

A Can you... you...? 

Q You developed code terms such a3 you ~~ 

A "You" me?

work for you at a specific time? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, vague, 

speculative, assumes facts not in evidence,

sorry. 

Q Ifanother employee of yours were to

12 ~~ could read it later, what would that message be 
13 written on? 

14 A Most likely paper. 

15 Q Okay, is that paper typically in the 

16 ~~ form of a message pad that has a carbon copy 
17 sheet to the back? 

18 A No. 

19 Q You're unfamiliar with the documents 

20 that I'm talking about, that being a message pad 
21 that informs you as to who called, the time they 
22 called and the purpose for calling? | 
23 MR. PIKE: For purposes of the question 
24 you're specifically talking about a message

as a trash pull, just what someone takes as 

a message at Mr. Epstein's home and -- 

‘A. Dol know what a message pad is? 

Q No. In your home, do you typically have 
your housekeeper, housemanager, or somebody elsd 
when they take a message for you, write ona 
specific pad that informs you as to who is 
calling, the time they are calling and the 
purpose for their catling, and there is a carbon 
copy sheet evidencing that message? 

MR, PIKE: Objection, asked and. 

answered. 

Q You know what I'm talking about? 

A_ Tknow what a message pad is. 

Q Do you use them commonly in your home or 
did you back prior to your arrest? 

A_ I would like to answer that question, 
but today my attorneys have advised me } have to 
assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution, so therefore, I'm going to do that 
or | risk losing their representation. 

Q Is my question to you confusing? De you 
know what Fm talking about? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 


A Not specifically, no. 
Q Okay. 
The information -- 

A. Is there something you have to show me, 
30 1 know what you're talking about? 

Q I don't have it ¢ show you today, but 
if the information and evidence that I have 
learned through this process is accurate and 
correct, it would seem a foregone conclusion that 
you and I would be on the same page, at least 
about this document, so -- 

A Okay. 

Q -ifwe are going to get to a point you 
tell me “This document doesn't exist" or "E don’t 
know what you're talking about," okay, that's 
fine, but that’s something we can hash out. 

Here is my question: When a 
housekeeper/housermanager would take a message fo 
you from any caller, is there a specific message 
pad that has a carbon copy located near your 
telephone, for them to write down the aame of the 
caller, the purpose for the call and the time 
called? 

MR, PIKE; Form. 

Q Is that something you're familiar with?

Q You're invoking your Fifth Amendment

THE WITNESS: Can you throw me one of 

the suckey candies, please 

Thank you. 

MR. EDWARDS: (Handing candy.) 

THE WITNESS: Appreciate it. 

Q Isn't it true you met L.M. for the first 
time in July or August of 2002 just before her 
fourteenth birthday? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A You know, your firm has been accused by 
the U.S, Attorney of perpetrating one of the 
largest frauds in South Florida history by 
crafting sexually charged lawsuits against people 
like me and others in order to fleece 
unsuspecting investors here in South Florida out 
of millions of doflars. The firm of you and Mr. 
Jaffe. The U.S. Attorney described it as bogus 
schemes contrived by your firm. 

I would like to answer every one of your 
questions here today; however, my attorneys have 
counseled me that I may not, and have advised me | 
that I have to invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth | 
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights undex 
the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, that's what 
will do, otherwise J risk fosing their 


representation. 

Q Isn't it true L.M. as a 13 or 14-year 
old girl was taken to your house by another 
underage minor female, that being Carolyn 
Andriano? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Tissue, please. 
MR. EDWARDS: (Handing tissue.) 

A [would like to answer that question 
like all the other questions you've asked me here 
today, but today my attorneys have counseled me 
that I have to invoke my Sixth Amendment right, Z| 
my Fifth Amendment right and Fourteenth Amend 
rights under the U.S, Constitution; therefore 
that's what I will do. 

Q Do you know who Carolyn Andriano is, 
right, she had a lawsuit against you previously? 

MR. PIKE: Form, 

A. Again the last name? 

Q Carolyn Andriano. 

A Could you spell it for me? 

Q Well, the pseudonyat that she used in her 
lawsuit against you alleging similar facts to 
those alleged in L.M. versus Jeffrey Epstein was 
C.M.A, versus Jeffrey Epstein, 








104 


A. And now the question? 
Q You know whe she is, correct? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 

A_ I would like to answer that question 
here, Mr, Edwards, but unfortunately today my 
attorneys have counseled me { must invoke my 
Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteent 
Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution, and 
if { dont, } risk losing their representation, 
therefore ] must assert those rights, 

Q When I asked you about L.M. or Carolyn 
Andriano, you sat there for a while thinking har 
about whether or not you knew them. Do you 
remember either L.M. or Carolyn Andriano? 

MR. PIKE: I move to strike counsel's 
statement because the statement as worded 
assumes facts certainly not in evidence. It 

is argumentative, speculates as to what is 

“thinking hard," and, counsel, I don't 

understand the question on the table, 

combined with your narrative. If you could 

repeat the question? 

MR. EDWARDS: Sure. 

Q I'm asking if during this questioning 
process, has it refreshed your recollection as to 

105 


who L.M. is or do you really have no idea who 
that is? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Asked and answered. 

Q Do you remember L.M.? 

A Are you going to ask one question? 
Which question would you like answered first? 

Q Do you remember £.M.? 

A_ I would like to answer that question. 1 
would like to answer that question today; however 
my attorneys today have advised me that | must 
assert my Fourteenth Amendment, Fifth Amendmen! 
and Sixth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution, no matter how much I would like to 
answer these questions. So unfortunately, I'm 
going to assert those rights. 

Q When you first met L.M., isn't it true 
that she was just about to begin her ninth grade 
year in high schoo!? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. Form. 


A_ I believe her testimony in front of the 
FBI, in a sworn deposition says something else, 
but I don't recall exactly what. | don't have 
any recollection. 

Q OfL.M.

A You asked the question when I met her, I 
think, if T met her, 

Q You have no recollection as to when you 
met her? 

A [don't have recollection if I ever met 
her. I just told you, I did read her FBI 
statement, so ] know what she has said and it is 
not what you've just represented to me. 
Q Your only knowledge of any interaction 


you may have had with L.M. is derived from an FB: 


statement that she gave; is that true? 
A believe what you just represented she 
said was not what she had sworn to. 
Q I'm not asking what she said. I'm 
asking do you independently remember if she was 
entering into ber ninth grade year of high school 


when you met her? Independent of anything you've 


read. 
MR. PIKE: All right, let me just move 
to strike the... Diatribe between Mr. 
Edwards and Mr. Epstein. I'm confused as to 
what question is on the table now, 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 
Q Independent of anything you've ever 
read — 





A Okay. 
Q = do you remember meeting L.M., just 
before she entered into her ninth grade year in 
high sekool? 

A [would like to answer that question, 
however my attorneys today have advised me that 
though her own statements are contradictory to 
what you just said, her sworn statements to the 
FBI contradict what you just said. | have to 


invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 


Fourteenth Amendment rights to the U.S. 
Constitution, 
Q Just a few minutes ago when you asked 


when you met her, you said, "J don't know if T'vel 


ever met her,” so is that your testimony, that 
you don't know if you ever met L.M.? 

A My testimony is very clear. [ must 
assert the rights my attorneys have asked me to 
assert today, though her testimony under oath to 
the FBI is not what you represented it to be, to 
me, and the ladies and gentlemen of the jury who 
are watching this, hopefully. 

MR. PIKE: Form. 
Q We will get into that, 
A Okay.

Q Isn't it erue that during this sexual 
massage, while you were — that you masturbated

inserting your fingers into L.M.'s vagina? 

MR, PIKE: Objection, argumentative,

A Though I would like to answer that 
question with specificity and detail today, no 
matter how much I would like to, my attorneys

assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution or potentially fose effective 
representation, so therefore, I will assert those 
rights. 

Q Isn't it true that the ritual that I'm 
describing occurred with L.M., approximately 10 
times when she was between the ages of 13 and 16: 

MR. PIKE: Same objections, with the 
additional objection of vague and 
confusing, 








A Since your firm has been involved -- 
according to the U.S. Attorney in crafting these 
fraudulent lawsuits in order to fleece local 
investors, and the fact that I believe in L.M.'s 
sworn statements, that's what you've just alleged 
at least is totally contradicted by your client's

against L.M. that I've just described, isn't it

more than 50 other underage minor females for yor 
to similarly abuse? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A Though { believe in her own sworn 
testimony to the U.S. government that she 
contradicts those assertions, and I'm sure maybe 
you'll have some explanation at trial, but the

MR. PIKE: Confusing, compound and -- if 
the court reporter would read back Mr. | 
Epstein’s response, I think you will see the 
way you just phrased the question 
mischaracterizes bis testimony. Because -- 
weil, I'll keep it there unless you want me 
to go further. You want me to go further? | 

MR. EDWARDS: No, | want him to go 
further. | 

MR. PIKE: Mischaracterizes the | 
witness's testimony. 

A L.M.'s own statements contradict every 
one of your allegations that you've made to me 
today, as a hypothetical. In her own words. And 
you -- and the potential reasons this concems me 
is the fact that the law firm that represented 
L.M. and two others have been accused by the U.S, 
Attorney of fraudulently producing cases against 
me and others, to fleece investors in what he’s

described as one of the largest frauds in South 
Florida's history. So, it concems me. It is a 
factor in the way I'm thinking about answering. 
Sorry, 

Q Each time that you digitally penetrated 
LM. or otherwise foudled her sexually, you paid 
her $200; is that correct? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
speculative, harassing. It assumes facts 
not in evidence, and with regard to this 
line of questioning, the Court has already 
ruled that the demeanor in which you're 
presenting this question is improper, and 
harassing, so if you would -- 

MR. EDWARDS: I'm very comfortable with| 
the demeanor right now, Mr. Pike. These are 
Just the facts of the lawsuit. The facts 
are outrageous and f understand that, but 

they have to be asked. 

MR. PIKE: Maybe the demeanor and tone 
of your question is Jaced in a manner that 
itis proper for the video, bat the content 
of the question is the same exact harassing 
question that was deemed by the Judge to be 
atgumentative. I'm not saying that he’s not 





121 


going to answer your question. 
MR, EDWARDS: Okay. 
MR. PIKE: Or that you don't know what 

his answer will be, but what I'm saying is: 

could you rephrase the question? 

Q Answer that question. I'll work on 
rephrasing it for you at some point, 

A Sony, I forgot what the question is by 
now. 

Q Isn't it true that each time that you 
interacted with L.M. sexually, meaning digitally 
penetrated her or fondied her in some other way] 
that you paid her $200 each time? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Sorry? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Go ahead. 

A_ I would like to answer each one of your 
questions here today. However, my attorneys have 
counseled me that today | have to assert my Fifth 
Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment rights under the U.S, Constitution and 
I'm cognizant of the fact that your fiem has 
crafted these malicious lawsuits, it has been 
reported that the lawsuits are of a sexual 
nature, in order to fleece investors, so though I 


31 (Pages 118 to 121) 

















U.S. Legal Support 
(561) 835-0220 








would like to answer those questions, Mr, | 
Edwards, and Mr. Jaffe, today 1 must keep my [ 
counsel's advice, i 

Q Isn't it true that for each underage | 
minor that LM. brought to you for the purposes | 
of you engaging in sexual activity, you paid her | 
$200? | 

MR. PIKE: Objection, speculation, 

Compound question, and it assumes facts not 

in evidence. Therefore lacks predicate. 

A Though I would like to answer that 
question, as most of your other questions here 
today, Mr. Edwards, I intend to respond, 
hopefully at some point to all of your questions, 
but today my attorneys have advised me I must 
invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment right under the U.S. 
Constitution. 

Q Over the course of relatively a roughly 
three years, isn't it true that you touched or 
fondled L.M. in a sexual manner on more than SO 
occasions? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative. 

Calls for speculation, It is overbroad, 

confusing and vague, and it assumes facts 


I 





not in evidence. 

A. Could you repeat the question for me? 
T'm sorry, Mr, Edwards, 

Q Yes. The three-year period between 2002 
and 2005 when you were engaging in sexual conduct 
with L.M., isn't it true that that conduct took 
place on more than 50 occasions? | 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A {believe if you read your own client's 
FBI statements, what her statement -- it changed ' 
dramatically after she decided to file a 
different lawsuit, at the request of you and your | 
firm, with one of your firms -- there have been. | 
many firms it seems, was accused of major fraud. | 
Since the testimony has changed dramatically, I i 
would like to answer those questions, but today [ 
my attorneys have advised me J must assert my | 
Sixth Amendment right, my Fifth Amendment right 
and my Fourteenth Amendment right. i 

| 





Q ** Your answers are not going to 
incriminate you if the answer is "no," it is only 
if the answer is "yes" that it will incriminate 
you, so aren't you telling the jury every single 
thing I've asked you is not part of a fraud, just 
happens to be true, isn’t it? 


124 


MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
irrelevant and move to strike. I'm simply 
going to instruct the witness not to answer 
that question because... I don't understand 
it. I don't know what to say about that 
question, 
A (Gesturing.) 
Q Allof the things that I've told you or 
9 that I've asked you about, you touching her whi 


ON How 





10 she was underage, you paying her for sexual 
11 conduct, those are all things that really 
12 happened, there is nothing about that, that 
13 anybody has fabricated or made up, is there? 
14 MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
is speculative, it assumes facts not in 
16 evidence, it certainly mischaracterizes the 
17 witness's testimony all day, since I have 
18 been here, and I have been here the whole 
19 time. It assumes facts not in evidence. It 
20 is also overbroad and substantially compound 
21 because you're attempting to incorporate all 
22 of your questions today into one question. 
23 MR. EDWARDS: | think you know, Mr. 
24 Pike, your objection should be limited to 
25 the form. Ifyou object to the form, it is 

1 fine. 

2 MR. PIKE: I'm sorry, that's ~ 

3 MR. EDWARDS: You -- 

4 MR. PIKE: You've asked me several times 

5 today fo tell you why. I thought I was 

6 helping. I'm sorry. I certainly will keep 

7 objecting to 

8 MR. EDWARDS: Appreciate it. 

9 MR. PIKE: - the form. 
10 MR. EDWARDS: Thank you. 
1 Q And your answer is? 
12 A_ Repeat the question. 
13 Q Every single allegation that L.M. has 
14 ~~ made and £ have now questioned you about in term} 
15 of your sexual involvement with L.M., they are 
16 al true; isn't that correct? There is nothing 
17 fabricated about any of these allegations, 
18 correct? 
19 MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
20 speculative, compound, It is vague, 
2h overbroad -- 
22 MR. EDWARDS: You're objecting to form? 
7 MR. PIKE; Yes, assumes facts not in 
24 evidence and lacks predicate. That is 
25 form.

A And I would like to answer that question } 
specifically today, however, on advice of counsel 
they've suggested I take the Sixth amendment ~ i 
assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution, keeping well aware of your firm's 
responsibility in the largest fraud in Florida's 
history by crafting sexually charged lawsuits 
against people like me and others. 

1 believe in addition, since her 
allegations, as you've phrased them, have changed 
dramatically since her sworn statement, until in 
fact, after she joined this firm charged with 
this major fraud and most of her statements have 
changed, I believe, so... 


} 
Q You remember when L.M. became pick 


when she was 16 years old, don't you? 
MR. PIKE: Form, relevance, move to 


| 
strike? | 


A_ I would like to answer each one of your 
questions here today, Mr. Edwards; each and every 


one of your questions. However, today my counsel | 
i 


has told me I must assert my Sixth Amendment, 
Fourteenth Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights 
under the U.S. Constitution. 






Q Isn't it true that when L.M. was 14 


years old, 15 years old and 16 years old, you i 


touched her genitals? 
A Separate from the fact that in her own 


testimony, her own sworn testimony under oath } 


before she decided to file a tawsuit for money, 
there was never any discussion about anything 


like that. T would like to answer that question, j 


but my attorneys have advised me, at Jeast today, 
that I must assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth 
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights unde; 
the U.S. Constitution. 
Q Isn't it true when she became pregnant 
at age 16, you no longer interacted with her 
sexually but still demanded that she bring you 
other underage minor females for you to sexually 
exploit? 
MR. PIKE: Objection, speculation. 
Compound. Harassing, and assumes facts not 
in evidence. 
A I believe her testimony changed 
dramatically from her sworn statements to the 
FBI ~ 
Q That's not a responsive —- 
MR. PIKE: Excuse me — 





; 12

128 


1 MR. EDWARDS: It is not a responsive 
2 answer so I won't allow -- 
3 MR. PIKE: That -- 
4 MR. EDWARDS: We'll move to strike it. 
5 Let's have an answer to the question. 
6 MR. PIKE: The witness is trying. If 
7 there is a legal basis for your moving to 
8 strike, it would be taken up with the Court 
9 and you can move to strike, 
10 You can continue, 
iL MR. EDWARDS: Strike it, it is 
nonresponsive? 
13 A Your allegations that you keep throwing. 
14 — at me, relate to the fact that L.M. testimony, 
15 after giving a sworn statement to the FBI, 
16 changed dramatically after she decided to file a 
17 lawsuit for money, joining your firm that's been 
18 accused by the U.S, Attorney of one of the 
19 largest frauds in Florida's history. 1 would 
20 like to answer those questions; however, on 
21 advice of counsel today I must assert my Fifth 
22 Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth 
23 Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. 
24 Q When L.M, was a pregnant 16 year-ol 
she brought you at least ten underage 


1 females during her pregnancy; isn't that true?! 
2 MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 

3 speculation. It is vague and assumes facts 

4 not in evidence and lacks predicate: 

5 A 1-~1-- unfortunately would like to 

& — answer that question as well as every other 

7 question you've asked me here today, but my 

8 attommeys have advised my I must assert my Fifth’ 
9 Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth 


10 Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. 
12 @ After L.M. had her son at 16 years old, 
12 and you were being criminally investigated fo 
13 some of the conduct that we've discussed here 
14 today; isn't it true that you personally hired 
15 and retained and paid for an attorney to 

16 represent L.M.? 

17 MR. PIKE: Objection, speculation -- 

18 MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form, Mr. 
19 Pike. 

20 MR. PIKE: 1 will not. Iam allowed to 

21. assert the basis for my objections, I am not 
22 limited to just saying "form." I'm able to 

23 assert the basis as to why, so I don't waive 
24 that basis.

MR. PIKE: It’s not obstructionist, it 

is objecting to form. What is 

obstructionist is what we are doing now. } 

will be finished within four seconds. So I 

am going to object to form, it's 

argumentative, speculative and it assumes 
facts not in evidence and it lacks |

A I'm sorry. (Witness shrugs.) Again? 

Q. The response to the question, 

A I don't know the question. 

Q You don't remember the question? Did 
you hire L.M. an attorney at some point in time? 
Do you remember that? 

MR. PIKE: Same objection. 

A Not to the best of my recollection. 

Q Do you know James Eisenberg? 

A .. Dol know James Eisenberg? I don't 
believe I've ever met James Bisenberg. 

Q Isit your testimony today then that you 
never paid for an attorney to represent L.M.? 
A (Witness shakes head,)... On advice of 
my counsel, f would like to answer that question, 
but on advice of counsel I'm going to have to 


131) 


assert my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment 
and Fifth Amendment rights against — exouse me, 
Sixth Amendment rights of the U.S. Constitution, 

Q And that attorney that was paid for by 
you, informed L.M. that if she were to tell the 
FBI exactly what happened at your house, that het 
son could be taken from her. You're aware of 
that, correct? 

MR, PIKE: Same objections. 

A Lrecognize, | believe she made one of 1 
the statements at her deposition after she \ 
decided to sue me for a bunch of money and your | 
firm has represented a number of... cases of a i 
sexually charged nature that tumed out to be | 

I

fraudulent in order to fleece loca! investors. 
The U.S. Attorney described your firm and these 
cases as a bogus scheme, and I'm aware of that, 
and would like fo answer your question in more 
detail today, Mr. Edwards, however my attorneys 
advised me that at least today, I must assert my 
tights under the Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth 
Amendment and Fifth Amendment. 

MR. PIKE: Itis the food. 

MR. JAFFE: I didn't want him in the

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the video 
record 2:29 p.m, 
(Pause in the proceedings.) 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the video 
record 2:50 p.m. 
Q Isn't it true, Mr. Epstein, that you 
gave L.M. money to coerce her into interacting 
with you sexually? 
A Mr. Edwards, I would like to answer each 
and every one of your questions here today, but 
unfortunately, like I've done with mostly all of 
your other questions, I'm going to have to assert 
my rights, Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendmen} 
and Fifth Amendment on advice of counsel. 
Although I would like to answer, if | don't 
follow my counsel's advice, I risk losing 
representation. 
Q While committing these sexual acts 
against L.ML when she was just a minor, you tne 
it would psychologically damage her; isn't that 
true? 
MR. PIKE: Form, tacks predicate, 
speculation. 
A. Lintend to respond at some point to -- 





1 would like to respond to each and every one of 
your questions, but today on advice of. my counsel 
they've required me to assert my Fifth Amendment, 
Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right 
under the U.S. Constitution, though I would like 
to answer each of these questions. 

Q In fact, you deliberately and 
intentionally caused severe emotionally distress 
to underage minor females, including L.M.; iso't 
that true? 

MR, PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
speculation, it is compound. And it assumes. 
facts not in evidence. 

MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 

A I would like to answer that question, as 
I would like to answer all of your other 
questions today regarding L.M, However, my 
attorneys today have advised me that | must 
assert my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation and my Fifth Amendment right and 
my Fourteenth Amendment right. Though I would 
like to answer that with specificity, ] must 
follow my attorney's advice. 

Q Will you admit for the jury that you 
were investigated federally for your illegal

activities with underage minors? 
MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A. | would like to answer that question, as 
well as all the other questions you've asked me 
here today, especially since your firm has been 
accused by the federal, I guess, the federal 
government,... being considered a criminal -- you 
firm has been considered and investigated as 
being a criminal enterprise using sexually 
fabricated, sexual cases... fabricated cases, to 
fleece investors out of millions of dollars, but 
I would like to answer your questions; however my 
attorneys have demanded that I assert my rights 
under the Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q In fact, as a result of that 
investigation, you, as well as the United States 


Attorney's Office entered into what has now been 


known and referred to as the nonprosecution 
agreement; isn't that correct? 
MR. PIKE: Same objection. The document 
speaks for itself? 
A You have to repeat the question. 
Q Asaresult of the criminal 


investigation into your activities with minor 






135 
females, you reached a resolution with the United 
States Attorney's Office, in what has now been: 
described as the nonprosecution agreement; is 
that correct? 
MR. PIKE: I'm going to object, Vague, 
confusing, misrepresents the agreement and 

the document is the best evidence. Will you 

mark it? 

MR, EDWARDS: I can mark it. We will 

copy it at the end and mark it as Exhibit 2. 

(Document, Nonprosecution Agreement, was 
deemed marked as Exhibit number 2 for 
identification, as of this date.) 

A Yes. 

Q In that agreement, there are listed 
co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein, those being 
Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Leslie Graff 
(phonetic) and Nadia Marcinkova, Can you explaii 
to the jury what those individuals did for you 
related to the crimes that were investigated by 
the federal government? 

A Co-conspirators? 

Q Yes, it says "criminal charges against 
any co-conspirators of Epstein including but not 
limited to Sarah Ketfen, Adriana Ross, Leslie

Graff or Nadia Marcinkova." Can you explain 
the jury what each of those four individuals did 
for you or conspired with you to do? 
MR. PIKE: Object to the form of the 
question? 

A. I would like to answer that question, 
however, today my attomeys advise me that | must 
assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution, 

Q Isn't it fair to say that you, as well 
as the co-conspirators, operated as an organized 
criminal enterprise designed to sexually exploit 
underage minors? 

MR. PIKE: Object to argumentative, 
speculation, It is vague and it assumes 

facts not in evidence. 

A Are you suggesting it was a criminal 
enterprise? Is that the words? 

Q Yes. 

A Though J would like to answer that 
question today, J think the only criminal 
enterprise that | have been reading about today 
was your firm, that’s been accused of being a 
criminal enterprise involved in defrauding. 





people, using mail fraud, wire fraud, money 
laundering, the operation of the enterprise -- 

this is by the U.S. Attorney (indicating), but 
though I would like to answer your questions with 
specificity today, on advice of counsel, though I 
would like to answer it, they demanded I assert 

my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment and. 
Fifth Amendment right or I risk losing their 
representation. 

Q Did you care about any of the underage 
minor females at the time when you were engagin; 
in sexual conduct with them? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative. 
Harassing, already been ruled upon by the 
Court relative to this exact question. 

MR. EDWARDS: | feel comfortable with 
the question. It goes to punitive damages. 

The issue related to the Court was a 

repetitive question on that topic or around 

that general subject matter. I'm just 

asking for Mr. Epstein to telf the jury how 

he felt about these girls, whether he cared 

about them, when he was engaging in illegal 

sexual conduct with them, 

MR. PIKE: Counsel, I'm going to

You can certify it to the Court, if you | 
like. You know what the answer is going to | 
be; however you're attempting to lace this

ordered that these types of questions are 

not permitted because they are argumentative

if T do so, { risk losing my effective i

Q Isn'ti¢ trae, Mr. Epstein, that the i 
only thing that you cared about was accessing as

Q Isn't it true that the only thing that 
you cared abent when you were interacting with 
these underage females in a sexual manner, was

U.S. Constitution, or else | risk losing their

MR. PIKE: And Mr, Edwards, just so we 
don't have to come back on the question that 
Linstructed him not to answer, if you would 
go ahead and repeat that question, I will be 
more than happy to let him respond. 

MR. EDWARDS: I don't remember the 
question we will take it up with the Court 
and we'll get a ruling on it. 

MR. PIKE: It was whether or not he 
cared about these -- I believe you quoted it 
as underage minors, but I would fike the 
court reporter to read back the question 
just to conserve judicial resources and not 
go back. So if she can reread the question 
that would be good. 

MR. EDWARDS: If you can find the 
question. 

THE COURT REPORTER: Certainly. 

MR. EDWARDS: J think I know it. 


minor females that you were engaging in sex with| 
at the time when you were engaging in these 
sexual activities? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections, as before. 

A Though I would like to answer that 
question as well as most of your other questions, 
if not all of your other questions here today, on 
advice of counsel I will have to assert my

L.M., you kuew that this conduct was illegal,

Q In fact, you told many of these underage 
minor females not to tell anybody what happened 
with you in the house, or else they would bein = | 
trouble; isn't that tree? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A I would like to answer that question, as 
well as the other questions; however, my counsel 
has advised me that today 1 must assert my 
Fourteenth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fifth 
Amendment rights under the U.S, Constitution. 

Q The underage minor females that have 
come forward with information about your sexual 
interactions with them have been investigated, 
harassed, humiliated in an effort for you to 
intimidate them to go away. Is that true? 

MR. PIKE; Objection. Argumentative, | 
speculative, compound. It is overbroad, and 
assumes facts not in evidence, 

A Can you repeat the question? 

Q Sure. Any underage minor female that 
you engaged in sexual activity with, that has now ; 
pursued a lawsuit against you, isn't it true that i 
you've spent a lot of money and a lot of j 

vestigating them in an effort to { 
143 
intimidate them and hopefully make them go away? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A [believe your client's testimony 
changed dramatically when she joined up with you 
and your law firm, accused of fraud, when she 
decided to change her testimony, at least from 
what the statements said, both to the police and 
to the FBI, and decided to seek money. However, 
anything above that or beyond that, I'm going to 
have to, in fact, assert my Fifth Amendment, t 
Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights | 


as directed by my competent counsel, 
Unfortunately, they have told me if i don't, 1 
risk losing their representation. | 

Q All right, I'll give you a chance here I 
since you keep bringing up her statement tothe — | 
FBI as opposed to her sworn testimony for 13 | 
hours under oath in this case. Are you saying 
that the sworn testimony to the FBI was, in fact, | 
the truth? | 

& What I'm saying is, it seems her i 
testimony has changed dramatically after she | 
joined your firm, that’s all. 

Q Okay. Irrespective of her testimony, 
you've read her testimony and you read her 





wer onewnr 





24 






testimony -- to the FBI. You watched her 
deposition when it was being taken. Which -- 

A You're making assumptions, I'm sorry. 

MR. PIKE: Let him finish the question. 
THE WITNESS: Sorry. 

A My fault, 

MR. PIKE: Then I'l! object and you'll 
respond. 

Q Which are you saying is the truthful 
testimony, her statement fo the FBI or the 
videotaped deposition that you watched? 

MR. PIKE: Object to the form. 

A What I've said, and J think Til repeat 
myself is until she joined your firm and started 
to seek money, her testimony was different. 
That's my understanding. 

Q Are you denying any sexual involvement 
with 1.M, at this time? 

MR, PIKE: Form. 

A. L would like to answer that question. T 
would like to answer it as with most of your 
questions here today; however, my attorneys have 
advised me that I must take that -- assert my 
rights under the Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth 
Amendment and Fifth Amendment, no matter how mut 




























145 


IT would like to answer that question, or 
potentially risk losing my counsel. 

Q Isn't your game plan with all of these 
civil lawsuits that have been filed against you, | 
to spend as much money as you can to Investigate, 
and harass these young women inte hopefully 
dropping the lawsuits against you? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, Relevance. Move 

to strike. It is argumentative and 

harassing. 

A_ I would like to answer that question. 1 
think you know the answer to that question. 

Q Yes. 

A (Witness nods.) However, today my 
attorneys have advised me J must assert my Sixth 
Amendment rights, my Fourteenth Amendment right: 
and my Fifth Amendment rights. 

Q You don't have any remorse for the 
sexual abuse that you committed against L.M., do 
you? 

MR. PIKE: Objection. It is 
argumentative, It is harassing. Itis, 1 
believe, confined under the Judge's order 
and it assumes facts not in evidence? 

A. That being said, | would like to answer

advised me that [ must assert my Fourteenth

my Sixth Amendment rights. | 

Q Infact, you recently sued L.M., didn't | 
you? 

A Yes, and you and your firm that's been 
accused of the largest fraud in Plorida's 1 
history, described by the U.S. Attomey as a 
criminal enterprise invoived in money laundering, | 
conspiracy fo commit one crime -- excuse me, mail 
fraud, commit conspiracy to commit wire fraud, | 
Yes, I sued you, your firm and L.M. 

Q ** Tell the jury ~~ 

A Yes. | 

Q -- the basis for the evidence that you 
have to support the allegations in the complaint | 
against L.M. | 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to instruct the 
witness not to answer that question in this 
medium, as it is wholly irrelevant 

currently, as were it, to this particular 

lawsuit. 

MR. EDWARDS: Just so you can rethink 

that position, the lack of remorse goes to i

punitive damages, that is an aspect of the i 
case that L.M. has against Mr. Epstein. i 

MR. PIKE: This lawsuit, the current one | 
Mr. Epstein is noticed for, and the lawsuit { 
in which Mr, Epstein has filed against the | 
former Rothstein, Rosenfeld, Adler, L.M. and [ 
Mr, Brad Edwards, is not proper for this | 
medium -- 

MR. EDWARDS: | understand your | 
position. | 

MR. PIKE: -- in that regard, I'm going i 
to instruct him not to answer any questions { 
relative to that lawsuit because of that } 
objection, as well as, it is my i 
understanding that Mr, Scarola has set Mr. | 
Epstein's deposition, I believe, either | 
early next week or mid-March, on the case of { 
Epstein versus RRA, Rothstein, Rosenfeld and | 
Adler, Mr. Edwards, as well as L.M. { 
Therefore when that time approaches, that i 
would be the appropriate time for those type 
of questions, related to that lawsuit,

Q ** But as it relates to, obviously L.M. 
sued you making the allegations that you sexually 
molested her from when she was 13 years old to 
when she was 16 years old and now you've sued he| 
in something that is seemingly related to that 
case, and 1 just want to understand what your 
factual basis is, or what evidence you're using 
to support your lawsuit against L.M., so that the 
jury can he valuate whether that is evidence of 
lack of remorse that would go to punitive damages| 
claims that L.M. has against you. 

MR. PIKE: | would instruct him not to 
answer that question, for the same reasons 

stated. 

MR. EDWARDS: Let's mark that. 

Q Is it your feeling that because you are 
wealthy and these children are poor, that you are 
entitled to sexually abuse them? 

MR. PIKE: Argumentative. 

Q In speaking about these children, and 
including L.M. 

MR. PIKE: Argumentative, speculation, 
compound, it's vague, and it assumes facts 
not in evidence, 

A In keeping with your firm's propensity 





149 
for filing fellactous (sic), manufactured, 
sexually charged cases, based on nothing but thin 
air, accused by the U.S. Attorney of the largest 
fraud in South Florida's history, by 
manufacturing sexual cases, F would like to 
answer each and every one of your questions, 
including why I sued you, but today I'm not going 
to be able to, [have to simply listen to my 
counsel and assert my Sixth Amendment, Fourteent! 
Amendment and Fifth Amendment right. 

Q This answer that you keep reciting, 
about the Rothstein, Rosenfeld, Adler firm -- 

A_ You do know who they are, right? 

Q -- you are aware, obviously, that all of 
the lawsuits that were filed against you, 
including L.M.'s, were filed at least a year 
before, or approximately a year before Rothstein, 
Rosenfeld, Adler had any of these cases; you're 
aware of that, right? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A_ Edo not know when Rothstein Adler got 
involved in these cases. I do know that the 
moment that they did surface, and, in fact, 1 
understand you shared information with all the 
other attorneys that you so -- that the jury

150] 





as 


should understand that the information 
gathered -- according to the U.S, Attorney, by 
illegal means, has been shared with all the other 
attorneys that you keep representing have filed 
cases against me; yes, I'm aware of that. 

Q I don't understand that answer. Stever, 
do you -- 

MR, PIKE: Do you have a question? 

MR. EDWARDS: | want to understand whal 
his answer was. As in all depositions, if 
you don't understand the answer, clarify the 
answer. 

MR, PIKE: No, you have to ask a 
question. 

MR. EDWARDS: I did. And he's 


MR. PIKE; The witness has answered the 
question. Do you have another question to 
clarify his answer? 

MR. EDWARDS: Yes. 


Q Please clarify your answer. i 


MR. PIKE: I will instruct him not to 
answer. It's vague and confusing, it’s 
narrative. 

MR, EDWARDS: Me saying " 








151 


answer" is narrative? | 
MR. PIKE: What do you mean by "clarify | 
your answer? 
MR. EDWARDS: i didn’t hear whathe = | 
said, Say it again so I can hear it. 
MR. PIKE: Would you please read back 


what Mr, Epstein just testified to, madam | 


court reporter. 
{The record was read.) 
MR. BDWARDS: Okay. 
MR. PIKE: It was an answer, a 


i 
question -- | 


MR. EDWARDS: I understand -- 1 mean 7 
don't understand the answer, but now I know 
the answer. 

MR. PIKE: Okay. 

Q At this point in time, please tell the 
jury what is your defense of the claims being 
asserted against you in this lawsuit by L.M.2 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to object. Calls 
for a legal conclusion. 

A What are the claims? So since you're 
representing L.M., can you tell me what the 
claims are? 

Q Yes, we've gone through it. She went to|

your house when she was 15, 14, 15, 16 years. 
old — 

A Is that a claim? 

Q -she was in your bedroom. You 
instructed her to get naked. You inserted your 
fingers into her vagina. You used a vibrator on 
her. You coerced her into recruiting other 
underage minor females, roughly 50 or so more, 

‘These are all claims that have amounted 

to various counts, coercion, prostitution, 
intentional infliction of emotional distress, 
battery, committing various crimes against her. 
What are your defenses to that? Normal defenses 
are “E didn't do it," "E did it, but it didn't 
hurt her,” we are trying to understand so we kno" 
how to previde this case to the jury, what are 
your defenses to these allegations? 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to object to this 
tine of questioning. It is compound; as 
worded it could call for disclosure of 
attorney/client information as well as work 
product. I believe in this particular case 
there is a document filed, answer in 
affirmative defenses, and the affirmative 
defenses are set forth there and the 





document there speaks for itself. 

MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 

Q Respond. 

A The document speaks for itself. 

Q ** So you agree with the affirmative 
defenses that were filed in your case? If you 
were te testify, we could expect that fo be your 
testimony? 

MR. PIKE: That's not what the witness 
testified. The witness testified that the 
document speaks for itself, and again, I'm 
going to object to attorney/client, work 
product and instruct the witness not to 
answer. 

Q I'm not asking what your legal defense 
is. I'm asking: What is your response to the 
claims? 

MR. PIKE: Same objection. 

Q What is your personal response? 

A I would like to respond to that 
question. | would like to respond today te that 
question; however, today my attorneys have told 
me that ] cannot respond. They've asked me to 
assert my Fourteenth Amendment, Sixth Amendm 
and Fifth Amendment rights of the U.S.

Constitution, though I would really like to 
tespond. They are telling me if] did so, { will 
lose risking their representation. 

Q I know you've invoked your Fifth 
Amendment rights related to many of these 
questions, but isn't it true you recently 
contacted George Rash at The New York Daily News 
and spoke to him about L.M.'s case as well as 
several of the other girls, who have claims 
against you? 

A Who? 

Q George Rush, New York Daily News. 

A Can you repeat the question? 

Q Dida’t you recently, within the last 
year, contact George Rush of The New York Daily 
News and discuss these cases that have been filed 
against you and the allegations made by these 
various females? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A. I would like to answer that question, 
but unfortunately today my attorneys have advised 
me Leannot. They've advised me ] must assert my 
Sixteenth -- excuse me, my Fourteenth Amendment, 
Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendment right, so 
therefore, I wilt do so. 


155 


Q Why is it that you will talk te George 
Rush about this but you will mot talk to the jary 
about this? 

MR. PIKE: Form. Argumentative, 
speculation. Misstates the witness's 

testimony. It assumes facts -~ the question 

assumes facts not in evidence and now lacks 

predicate, 

A. So who is George Rush again? 

Q George Rush, reporter with The New York 
Daily News. Did you not talk to him? If you 
didn't talk to him, tell me that, That's fine. 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A I would like to tell you answers to each 
one of your questions, however today my attorneys 
have demanded that J respond by asserting my 
Fourteenth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, Fifth 
Amendment privilege, though f would like to 
respond, but they said if} do so, I risk losing 
their representation, 

Q Didn't you tell George Rush these 
underage minors were not victims at all and that; 
regardiess of their age, you did not personally 
consider them victims? 

MR. PIKE: Same objection.

A (Laughter.)... Did | tell... | would 
like to answer that question, but today on advice 
of my counsel, | must -- as | have done with 
mostly each one of your questions, I have to 
assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and. 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution. 

Q You were $1 when L.M. was 14, and you 
were interacting with her sexually. Is it your 
testimony that despite the disparity in age you 
de not consider L.M. to be a victim? 

MR. PIKE: Argumentative, speculation, 
assumes facts not in evidence. Compound, 
lacks predicate, 

A Not only does it contradict your own 
client's statements to the FBI under sworn 
testimony, I would like to answer that question. 
Hopefully one day I can answer that question, but 
today my attorneys have said I cannot. They 
advised me I must assert my Sixth Amendment, 
Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right: 

Q In the last ten years, what is the 
youngest underage minor female that you have 
interacted with sexually? 





assumes facts not in evidence, 

A The answer to that question is -- I 
would like fo give you an answer to that today, 
but my attorneys have advised me | must assert my 
Fourteenth Amendment rights, my Sixth Amendment 
rights and Fifth Amendment rights. 

Q Do you know Michael Friedman? 

A_ Doesn't ring a bell, 

Q Former housekeeper/employee of yours, 
worked at the Palm Beach house? 

A ... Could. Don't know. 

Q So you would be unable to answer what 
Michael Friedman did for you? 

A Yes, 

Q Are you aware that our investigator 
spoke with Michael Friedman, former housekeepe! 
for you, or housemanager for you, out in 
California? 

A No. 

Q Any reason why when asked about the 
activity that occurred in your house, he would 
tear up and say, "I was hoping to forget 
everything I saw"? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative. 

Specuiative. Assumes facts not in

evidence. 

A Again, the question? 

Q Is there any reason that when asked -- 

A I don't know who he is. 

MR. PIKE: Also, hearsay. 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Counsel? 

MR. EDWARDS; Go ahead. 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the video

{Pause in the proceedings.) 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the video 

record 3:30 p.m. 

Q This person that I asked you about, 
Michael Friedman, is that somebody who has 
contacted you within the last six months? 

A No. 

Q In taking a break and thinking about 
some of these questions, have you remembered whd 18 
that person is, or still no real memory of him at i 19 
all? | 20 

A No real memory. 21. 

Q To the best of your knowledge, he never 22 
worked fer you? 23 

MR. PIKE: Form. 1 24 

A Not that I can recall, but there are 25 


159 


lots of people who work for me, $0... 

Q Can you tell the jury who the various 
people are that work for you now? 

A Lbelieve } answered that question 
already. 

Q In that you invoked your Fifth 
Amendment, correct? 

A That's correct, Sixth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Eigthteen and twenty-first? 

A (Witness shrugs.) 

MR. PIKE: Move to strike. 

Q ** Have you, during this litigation, and 
by "this litigation,” [ don’t only mean L.M.'s 
case, but the various other lawsuits that have 
been filed against you by other females alleging 
sexual misconduct by you against them, Who hav; 
you retained attorneys for, what witnesses have 
you retained attorneys for? 

MR. PIKE: Object to the form. 
MR, EDWARDS: Okay. 
MR. PIKE: I'll instruct him not to 

answer because I don't understand the 

question. Okay? 

MR, EDWARDS: All tight. 





Q During this civil discovery and 
litigation -- 

A Um-hum? 

Q ~have you paid for, and/or retained an 
attorney for any other witnesses?

tell you what I'm talking about, Lowella Rabuyo; 
you know who that is, right? 

A Yes. 

Q She is someone to works for you now, 
she's a housekeeper. We took her deposition 
already, At least that's what her testimony

Q That somebody who has informed us that

Rabuyo, Janusz Banaziak, Nadia Marcinkova, 
Ghislaine Maxwell, your brother, Mark Epstein, 
Naley Robson, Sarah Keilen, Larry Visoski, Lam 
Morrson, David Rogers, Igor Zinoview. Have ¥ 
missed anybody else that during this litigation 
you've paid for or retained attorneys? 

MR. PIKE: Form, same objection. 

A fm not clear. Are you suggesting I've 
paid for attorneys for all these people? 

Q Yes, 

A (Laughter,) ] would like to answer those 
questions today, but on the advice of counsel 1 
have to invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth 
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right. 

Q Ifyou have not, tell me which of those 
on that list that you have not paid for or 
retained attorneys for?

Q And is it you, personally, or is this |

Q As you sit here today, you're not really

corporations that we've discovered during

coerced L.M. into prostitution? 

MR. PIKE; Same objections, 

Af believe her own testimony reflects, at 
least the sworn statement to the FBI, reflects 
that that is not the case; and though I would 
like to answer that question in great detail, I 
cannot do so today on advice of counsel, that 
have asked me to assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth 
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights. If1/ 20 
do $0, I risk losing their representation. 21 

Q You would agree with me that you groomed 22 
L.M. into becoming a prostitute? 1 23 

MR, PIKE: I'm going to object. 24 
Argumentative, speculative. Certainly lacks 25

A You know I would like to answer that 
question, but I can't today, Under advice of 
counsel I have to assert my Fourteenth Amendment, | 
Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights. IfT | 
answer the question, I risk losing their | 
counsel, 

Q You would agree, wouldn't you, that you | 
brainwashed L.M. into believing that this 
lifestyle of prostitution was right? 

MR. PIKE; Same objections. 

A_ I would like to answer that question, as 
most of your other questions here today, Mr. 
Edwards. On advice of counsel today, I'm going, 
to have to assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth 
Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment rights. If | 
answer that question, J risk losing their 
representation. 

Q Would you agree that your interaction 20 
with L.M. when she was a minor, was degrading t@ 24 
her? 22 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 23

today; however, my counsel has advised me that I 
must assert my Fourteenth Amendment rights, my 
Sixth Amendment rights and my Fifth Amendment 
tights, and though | would like to answer those 
questions, if I do so J risk losing their 
representation. 
THE WITNESS: Can we take a ten-minute 
break for some air? 
MR. EDWARDS: We have 15 minutes and 
we're done. 
THE WITNESS: Continue then? 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 

Q Would you agree that you intentionally 
indoctrinated L.M. into this very deviant sexual 
lifestyle? 

MR. PIKE: Okay, I'm going to object. 

It is argumentative. It is confusing. It 

is speculative, vague, lacks predicate and 

assumes facts not in evidence. 

A And on top of that, | would like to 
answer that question, but my counsel has advised 
me J must assert my Fourteenth Amendment, Sixth] 
Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights under the 
U.S. Constitution. Although | would like to 
answer al! your questions today, I cannot do so 

169 


risking losing their representation. 

Q Would you agree that you were personally 

responsible for destroying her life? 
MR. PIKE: Same act objections. 

A Her lite? 

Q L.M.'s? 

A_ I would like to answer that question, 
and I understand how your firm has been accused 
of fabricated sexually charged jawsuits in order 
to fleece investors locally in South Fiorida. 

The U.S. Attorney has called your law firm a 
criminal enterprise based on filing fellacious 

(sic) sexually charged cases. Although | would 

like to answer that question today, Mr. Edwards, 

and Mr. Jaffe, my counsel has told me that I have 

to assert my rights under the Sixth Amendment, 

Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, and if 
1 don't do so, I risk losing their 

representation. 

Q We have a factual basis for asking every 
question and making every allegation. 1 want to 
provide you with a last opportunity to tell the 
jury which of these allegations, if any, being 
made by L.M., are false or fabricated in any 
way?

170} 
MR, PIKE: Same objections. Mr. | 

Edwards, you know the tenor of that question 

cannot be answered without waiver of Fifth, 

Sixth and Fourteenth. | appreciate the 

question and the semantics of it, but it 

is... It is -- can you rephrase it? 

MR, EDWARDS: Yes. 

Q Many times — you know the allegations 
now, we've gone through them, L.M.'s allegations| 
and assertion of facts as to what happened 
between you and her when she was 13, 14 and 15 
years old and you were 50, 51, 52 years old. 
Several times you responded saying something | 
about Rothstein, Rosenfeld & Adier, something 
about her FBI statement, what have you; I want tp 
give you a chance to tell the jury, which of her 
allegations, if any, that you believe now are 
false or fabricated in any way. 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A Lwould like to respond to that 
question, the fact that her firm, the law firm 
representing her has been accused by the U.S. 
Attorney of being a criminal enterprise, 
manufacturing, fabricating, out of thin air, 


171 


allegations in order to simply fleece locat 
investors out of millions of dollars, so 1 would 
very much like to answer that question regarding. 
the truthfulness of L.M.'s allegations; however 
today my counsel has told me that J must assert 

my Fifth Amendment rights, Sixth Amendment right 
and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution, though I would very much like to 
answer that questions but if I do f risk tosing 

their representation, 

Q Would you agree you owe L.M. at least 
$15,000,000 to compensate her for the damage 
which you have caused? 

MR. PIKE: Objection. | move to 

strike. Argumentative. Compound, Lacks 

substantial predicate. Assumes... facts... 

not in evidence. 

A As you might imagine, though your law 
firm has been accused of perpetrating a fraud 
involving millions and millions of dollars, on 
unsuspecting investors here in South Florida, 
millions of dollars by fabricating simitar 
ailegations, convincing people to give money to 
the firm that helped bring this lawsuit, I'm 
afraid I would like to answer those questions but 





172 


no matter how much | would like to answer those 
questions, | an going to have to decline based on 
my counsel's advice to invoke, at least today, my 
Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteent! 
Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution; 
because if] don’t, I risk losing their 
representation. 

Q Is it true that you're currently worth 
more than one billion dollars personally? 

A_ I would like to answer that question, as 
I would like to answer most of your other 
questions. { know that’s a lot of money -- 
actually the amount of money that the U.S. 
attorneys accused your firm of trying to steal 
from the people of South Florida. It was 1.2 
billion dollars, the U.S, Attorney claimed your 
firm perpetrated the largest fraud in South 
Florida's history by steating that sum of money 
from local investors, based on false allegations 
of sexually charged claims, and although I would 
like to answer these questions with specificity, 
under advice of counsel today, I'm going to have 
to refuse, based on my Sixth Amendment, 
Fourteenth Amendment and Fifth Amendment right, 


and though I would like to answer the question, I 


173 


have been told if] do so I risk losing their 
representation, Mr. Edwards, 

Q I'm simply asking: What is your 
personal net worth at this time? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A I think I've answered the question, 
but... 

Q What is your personal net worth at this 
time? So the answer should be a number or should 
be you invoking your Fifth Amendment rights. 
Seemed like the opposite. 

MR. PIKE: Asked and answered, he did. 
invoke his Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth. 

MR. EDWARDS: His answer included 
something about Rothstein, Rosenfeld and 
Adler stealing some certain amount of money, 
which obviously is nonresponsive, | move to 
strike it and ask that he actually responds 
to the question with something that's 
responsive. He can answer the question, 
invoke Fifth Amendment rights, and we will 
get out of here. 

Q We will start over again. 

Can you please tell the jury what your 

current personal net worth is currently?

A J would like to do that today, however, | 
I'm sure that one of the reasons, sinoe your firm 
has been accused of stealing millions of dollars 
from focal investors based on fabricated, totally I 
fabricated claims, this is not by me but the U.S, 
Attomey, has called your firm a criminal 
enterprise charged with stealing hundreds of 
millions of dollars frankly, from local 
investors, based on false claims of sexually 
charged nature, I would like to answer that 
question in detail. However, my attorneys have 
advised me I cannot answer any questions that may | 
be relevant to this lawsuit and by doing so, I 
must invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment) 
Fourteenth Amendment right and by answering the 
question, [ risk losing their representation. 

Q Is it true you're worth 1.8 billion 
dollars? 

MR. PIKE: Same objection. 

A Same answer. 

Q Put the answer. 

MR, PIKE: For the record. 

A. I'm sure that's an interesting question ' 
and | would like to answer that question for 
you. I'm sure you would like to know as your 


175] 


firm has been charged with stealing over a 
billion dotlars from local investors and your 
senior partner of both you and Mr. Jaffe sitting + 
there shaking his head, sits in jail accused of 
fleecing focal and foreign investors based on 

false sexual claims from people. And although I j 
would like to answer that question, like I would | 
answer most of your other questions, my counsel 
has advised me today, ladies and gentlemen of the 
jury, I cannot answer that question. Maybe IT can 
in the future. However, if I do so today, I risk 
losing their representation, so I must assert 

those rights under the Sixth, Fifth and 

Fourteenth amendments. 

Q You would agree, would you not, that it | 
would take a jury award of at least 45 million | 
dollars in punitive damages to punish you for { 
doing what you did to L.M.? ] 

MR, PIKE: Same objections. | 

A 1 would like to answer that question, as 
I would like to answer all your other and Mr. 
Jaffe's questions today. However, while he sits 
shaking his head I'm going to have to respond | 
to -- my counsel has advised me I cannot answer 
that question today, though I would like to.

Though I would like to answer with specificity, 
however if I do so, I risk losing their 
representation so | must assert my rights under 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Isn't it true, Mr, Epstein, that as long 
as you have the money to do it, you will continu 
to engage in sex with minors? 

MR. PIKE: Again, extremely 
argumentative, speculative. I'm allowing 

the question to give leeway, so we don't 

haye to come back here again. It is 

harassing. 

A And with that, I'm sure this -- fadies 
and gentiemen of the jury, will... be able to see 
you and your partner, who your firm has been 
accused of massive fraud in South Florida trying 
to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from 
local investors, from creating, fabricating 
malicious, sexually charged claims, called by the 
U.S. Attorney a criminal enterprise charged with 
money laundering, conspiracy to commit other -- 
federal violations, so though 1 would like to 
answer that question, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. Jaffe, 
today, { cannot. I must invoke my Sixth, Fifth 
and Fourteenth Amendment rights, on advice of 


Lv7 





counsel or risk losing their representation. 

Q Am I correct in my understanding that 
you have invoked your Fifth Amendment rights 
because your answers would incriminate you and| 
lead to your prosecution? 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to~ 
MR. EDWARDS; Exactly as phrased by Mr, 

Luttier to L.M, I did not say anything but 

allow her to answer the question. 
MR. PIKE: Object to the form. 

A In fact, since you are a lawyer I’m sure 
you're aware the Supreme Court has said the Fifth 
Amendment is used more often to protect innocent 
people. So that's -- but today on advice of 
counsel I've taken that right, 

MR. EDWARDS: (Gesturing.) 

MR. PIKE: I have no questions. 

We will read. 

MR. EDWARDS: No further questions. 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the video recor 

3:52 pm.

Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, 
Q Sir, what did you mean when you said

MR. PIKE; Asked and answered, form, 
A_ On advice of counsel, I have to assert 
my rights under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth

Q What facts do you know of to support the

statement that V.Z. actually consented to and was 20 


a willing participant in the acts alleged? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. [believe her deposition spoke to that 
directly, but however, myself, I'm going to have 
to assert my Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth. 


Amendment rights under advice of counsel, sir. 

Q You read her deposition, correct? 

A No. 

Q You have not read her deposition? 

A No. 

Q But you believe her deposition testimony 
correctly speaks to the issue of the fact that 
she was 2 willing participant in the acts alleged 
with you? 

A. That's not what I said. | 

Q Why don't you tell me what you meant 
when you said, "Her deposition testimony speak; 
to the issue.” 

A. The deposition speaks for itself. Any 
other questions I'm sorry, Mr. Horowitz, but 
today I have to assert my rights under the Sixth, 
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

Q Isn't it true, sir, that you are not 
aware of anyone who has facts that support the | 
statement that V.Z. consented to and was a i 
willing participant in the acts alleged in her 
lawsuit? 

MR, PIKE: Form, 

A My understanding of her own testimony in 

her deposition speaks to that matter, but,

however, with respect to my own issues today, I 
am going to have to assert my rights on the

Defenses says, "As to all counts alleged 
plaintiff, V.Z., actually consented to and 
participated in similar conduct and/or identical 
fo the acts alleged with other persons which wer 
the sole or contributing cause to plai 
damages."" 

Sir, you know that's not correct; is 
that correct? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 

A I believe her deposition, in her own. 
words speaks to this issue, but as far as today 
my to that question answer unfortunately will 
have to be that I assert my rights under the 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment on advice 
of counsel. 

Q Sir, isn't it true you're not aware of 
any facts to support your contention in this 
answer to the amended complaint that V.Z.. 
consented to and participated in conduct simila 
and/or identical to the acts alleged with other

persons? 
MR, PIKE: Form? 
A [believe her deposition in het own 
words speaks fo this exact question, but however, 
with respect to my answers today, unfortunately 
with respect to V.Z., though I would like to 
answer every question with respect to V.Z., on 
advice of counsel I have to assert my rights 
under the Fourteenth, Sixth and Fifth Amendment, 
Q Sir, my question was: What facts do you 
know to be true? Clarify for me. Are you sayin; 
that you are adopting what V.Z. says as true? 
MR. PIKE: Form, misconstrues the 
witness's testimony, and that is not exactly 
what your last question was, so I'm going to 
move + 
MR. HOROWITZ: Just to form + 
MR. PIKE: No, no, I'm not going to fet 
the witness answer a question that's going 
to potentially waive any Constitutional 
privileges here, so it will not be just 
“form.” 
Now, having said that, if you can repeat 
the question --

and Fourteenth Amendment right. 

Q Lewd and lascivious molestation is 
defined in Florida as a person who intentionally 
touches in a lewd or lascivious manner, the 
breasts, genitals, general area, or buttocks, or 


the clothing covering them, of a person less tha 
16 years of age, or forces or entices a person 
under 16 years of age to so touch the 
perpetrator.”” 
Having read that, isn't that a statute 
that you violated on numerous occasions agains 
Jane Doe when she was a minor? 
MR. PIKE: Form, 
A I would -- have to assert my rights 
under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment 
upon advice of counsel, Mr. Edwards. 
Q Subchapter six of that statute involves 
a crime of lewd and lascivious conduct that in 
Florida is defined as a person who intentionally! 
touches a person under 16 years of age in a te 
and lascivious manner, or a person who 
intentionally masturbates in the presence of a 
victim under 16 years of age." Those are also 
sections of that Florida statute that you 
violated against the then minor, Jane Doe; is 
that trae? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A_ I would tike to answer all of your 
questions with respect to Jane Doe, Mr. Edwards.

U.S. Legal Support 
(561) 835-0220 


MR. PIKE: ‘That's exactly what «- 

A You should ask my counsel. 

Q Here is my point: You've indicated to 
your Probation Officer this year, in fact, I'll 
ask it this way: Have you indicated to your | 
Probation Officer that Jean Luc Brunel has beea 
house guest of yours during the year 2010? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A [have been instructed by my counsel to 
answer that question, as I have been instructed 
to answer most of your other questions here 
today, which is by asserting my rights under the 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Do you know an attorney named Tama 
Kudman? 

MR. PIKE: Form - actually that’s not 

"form." I withdraw that. 

A No. 

Q Did Mr. Brunel tell you that Tama Kudmah 
was an attorney that was hired to represent him | 
in this case? 

MR. PIKE: I'm sorry, hold on. 
MR. EDWARDS: Did Mr. Brunel tell him. { 
MR. PIKE: Okay, form. | 

A. I'm going to have to answer that ! 


434 
question as I’ve answered most of your other 
questions here today, Mr, Edwards, which is by 
asserting my rights under the Sixth, Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

@ And did you or some entity that you own 
or control pay for the services of Tama Kudman ty 
represent Jean Luc Brunel, in this matter? 

MR. PIKE; Form. 

A ... I'm going to have to assert my rights 
under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment | 
upon advice of counsel. 

Q Tcertainly don't want to get into this 
too often during this deposition but it is 
visibly noticed on the video that prior ta the i 
invecation of the Fifth Amendment, there is a 
shaking of the head which commonly indicates thal 
the answer is “No,” and I just want to make sure 


we are ail on the same page, that that was not 
your indication and that we can ignore those 
types of body movements, as Mr, Pike instructed 
me that was the case last time, 
MR. PIKE: I think that the record is 

clear, The court reporter does not 

understand nods of the head, shakes of the 

head, “um-hum" -- 


i 
i 





435 


MR. EDWARDS: Agreed. 

MR. PIKE: His response is his verbal 
tesponse. 

MR. EDWARDS: | understand that, but 
certainly if witness is on the witness 
stand we both know they are allowed to 
observe the demeanor of the witness and part 
of that demeanor is the nodding or shaking 
of the head, which are common responses that 
is we all know and understand, { just want 
to make sure we are on the same page, the 
jury can ignore those body movements? 

MR. PIKE: As a matter of fact, and as 
you know, since you tried several cases, 
there is a pattemed jury instruction from 
the judge that says the jury can, in fact, 
take it into consideration. 

MR. HOROWITZ: That's the point. 

MR. PIKE: I cannot instruct the jury in 
this video deposition to ignore anything 
that occurs on this video. 

MR. EDWARDS: That's why I wanted to 
engage -- so 1 would make sure -- we are a 
little inconsistent obviously as to what the 
jury should be observing, what they can 


436 


yersus his response. | guess for this time 

we will get into it. 

Q In that last question that I asked you, 
related to you or some entity that you contro! 
paying for the services of Ms. Kudman, is the 
answer "no" or is the answer that you are 
invekiag your Fifth Amendment right to remal 
silent? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A. With respect to that question, as with 
respect to all your other questions here today, 

Mr. Edwards, upon advice of counsel I have to 
assert my rights under the Sixth, Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q isn't it true that you have specifically 
instructed Mr. Brunel to avoid his deposition in 
this case? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A. Upon advice of counsel, as with respect 
to most of your other questions here today, I'm 
going to answer that the same way by invoking my! 
rights under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth 
Amendment, sir. 

Q Mr. Epstein, can you describe for the 
Jury your various schemes that you have devised

MR. EDWARDS: With all due respect, I'm 
interpreting it as an intentional act 
designed to dilute the invocation of the 
Fifth Amendment and any adverse inference 
that we may be entitied to, and I think that 
you acknowledged previously that 4 jury will 
have or could have the ability to view this 
video, and I'm assuming a jury could make 
that same inference, so I want to make sure 
the record is just crystal clear. If the 
answer is one answer and there is no body

Q Mr. Epstein, is it true that you have 
sexually molested underage minors in every 
community where you have komes or houses? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Though J wouid like to answer each one 
of your questions here today, Mr, Edwards, I 
would like to answer that question, to you and 
your partner, who sits in jail for fabricating 
cases of a sexual nature against people like me 
and others in South Florida, but today, upon 
advice of my counsel, they've instructed me I 
must assert my rights under the Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

THE WITNESS: Before you go to the 
bathroom? 

MR. EDWARDS: Move to strike the portion] 
of the answer that was nonresponsive. 

MR, PIKE: One second. 

MR, EDWARDS: Move to strike the portion] 
of the answer nonresponsive, 

MR. PIKE: Move to strike your motion to 
strike. 





MR. EDWARDS: Based on the fact that if 
‘was responsive? You feel it was 
responsive? * 

MR. PIKE: Absolute -- listen -- 

MR. EDWARDS: it is fine if you do. 

MR. PIKE: You're harassing the witness, 
you're talking about heads and nod shakes. 
If you want to be clear for the record, 1 
think, and I'm -- I think -- I think the 
witness is nodding and shaking his head in a 
manner because your questions are 
argumentative, “Please tell me the scheme 
that you devised.” 

“Please tell me who you molested,” al] 
of these are argumentative questions -- 

MR. EDWARDS: If it wasn't true, it 
would be argumentative, 

MR. PIKE: They are just not formed 
right. You are sitting here subjecting the 
witness to questions that -- that are just 
argumentative. They are not structured 
appropriately, and you're taking that and 
you're implying something else for the jury 
on the record, and quite frankly, I don't 
appreciate that. So, yes, to answer your

Q Can you tell the jury what, if anything, 
Seott Rothstein has to do with the allegations off 
you molesting underage children? 

MR. PIKE: Form,

I don't do so, I risk losing that representation. 

Q What is special about the question of 
you molesting children on a daily basis for the 
better part of two decades, that you would 
especially like to answer that question? 

MR. PIKE: I'm sorry? 
MR, EDWARDS: His answer was that he 
would especially like to answer that 

previous question and the question posed to 

him was... 

Q Isn't if true for the better part of two 
decades you have molested children on an ever 
day basis. And I'm asking now, what is it about 
that question that makes you especially want to} 
respond to that one? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A. Though | would like to answer that 
question as well as your other questious here 
today, Mr. Edwards, upon advice of counsel, 
they've told me I must assert my rights under the

losing my representation, 
































Q Is it true that you have intentionally 
preyed on vatnerable children as young as 12 
years old on an every day basis, for sexual 
purposes for the last decade? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Though I would like to respond to that 
question, as weil as other questions posed by 
you,, and f would prefer to respond to both you 
and your partner, Scott Rothstein, who sits in 
jail for fabricating questions of a sexual 
nature, cases of a sexual nature against people 
like me and others in South Florida. You were 
part of a law firm that the U.S. Attorney refers 
fo as one of the largest criminal enterprises in 
South Florida’s history, so though I would like 
to answer, and you will probably mark my question] 
as nonresponsive, my counsel has told me today I 
must not answer that question and must assert my 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right. 

MR. EDWARDS: Move to strike the answer 
as nonresponsive. All other portions

invocation of the Fifth Amendment,

Jane Doe, as she is your client, but on advice of 
counsel they've instructed me that } must, must 
assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment right, so therefore that's 
what I'm going to do. 

Q Despite your preference you're going to 
listen to your counsel, | 
MR, PIKE: Form, I'm going to instruct 

you not to answer that question. 

MR. EDWARDS: As to whether or not he is 
going to listen to counsel? 1 
MR. PIKE: He's already invoked on 
advice of counsel. | 

MR. EDWARDS: That last question was |

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Youhave to repeat the question. 

Q Sure. The initiation, the manner in 
which you gained access to underage girls between, 
the ages of 12 and 17 in Palm Beach, is that you 
would initially have somebody tell them that they 
could come to your house and give you a massage 
and you would pay them for their time,

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Again? Repeat the question, 

Q This is a scheme that you've employed 
for years and years, and years, and somehow 
you're having a hard time grasping how a schema 
that you devised worked? 

MR. PIKE: No. Move to strike. You 

don't have a question on the table. 

Actually your previous question prior to 

what you just stated did not involve any 

word, quote, "scheme," end quote. Ifyou 

‘want to repeat the question, go ahead. 

Q Isn't this how it worked, that an 
underage minor female would come fo your hous 


and you instructed or did you instruct Sarah 
Kellen or one of your other assistants to lead

alone with you?

MR. PIKE: Form, 

A. Though I would like to answer all of 
your questions here today, I'm going to have to 
respond to that question as I've responded to 
most of your others here today, which is by my 
counsel's instructing me that F must assert my 
rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendment. 

Q Then, once the underage minor female wat 
naked, you would attempt various lewd or 
lascivious improper sexual acts against that 
underage minor female, correct? 

MR. PIKE: Form, 

A. Though I would like to respond to all of 
your questions, Mr. Edwards, | have to respond to 
that as | responded to all of the other questions 
here today that you've posed, which is that my

Fourteenth Amendment. | 


Q And you would always pay cash money to; 
the underage minor female after you improperly] 


and/or illegally sexually abused that underage | 
minor female, correct?

A. Though J would like to answer each and 
every one of your questions here today, Mr. 
Edwards, my counsel has advised me 1 must assert 
my rights under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth 
Amendment. 

Q Each of these sessions or sexual 
interactions between you and underage minor i 
females ended, when you had ejaculated, correct? 

MR, PIKE: Form, j 

A_ I would like to answer that question, as 
[ would like to answer all of your other 
questions here today. However, today at least, 
my counsel has instructed me that f must assert 
my rights under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth 
Amendment. | 

Q After paying the underage minor female { 
for being sexually molested, you would ask the i 
underage minor female fo leave her telephone 
number with one of your assistants; is that 
correct? 

MR. PIKE: Fonn, 

A. I would like to answer that question. 1 
would like to answer most of your other questions 
here today; however, at least today my counsel 
has advised me that I may not, and must assert my 





451 


tights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth. 
Amendment os, in fact, potentially lose my right 
to representation. 

Q What you're saying with that answer is 
that your counsel will not represent you anymord 
if you choose to waive your Fifth Amendment 
rights and begin to answer these questions? 

MR. PIKE: No, not at all. On the 

advice of counsel, if you know what the 

Sixth Amendment is and how it reads, you 

would understand what the invocation is, in 

full. So move to strike your ~ 

MR. EDWARDS; Question? 

MR. PIKE; -- last question, and it 
mischaracterizes the witness's testimony. 

Do you know what the Sixth Amendment is, Mr, 

Edwards? 

MR. EDWARDS: Yes, and it is not my 
deposition and I'm not sure your client 

knows about the effective assistance of 

counsel or any amendment ~ 

MR. PIKE: Do you know how due process 
clause affects the 6th Amendment? 

Never mind, just go ahead. I'm sorry. 

MR. EDWARDS: However, the statement 


452 


made if he answers the questions, as he 
would prefer to do, which seems remarkable 
and incredible, then he would be fired or 
you would be fired from him, and I want to 
understand what it... 

Q Why is it that your attorneys will no 
longer represent you if you choose to do what yo 
want to do, which is answer these questions? 

MR, PIKE: Move to strike. 

Do you want to ask a question? Because 
T'm not quite sure he even testified to 
that. We have been through several 
depositions and you are implying something 
from the invocation of the Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth that does not exist. There has 
been no mention of firing, there's been no 
mention of withdrawing, there's been no. 
mention of anything of the sort. 

MR. EDWARDS: Can we go back to the 
question and response that ended with "l 
risk losing my...” 

THE COURT REPORTER: Certainly. 

MR. PIKE: Once again, do you know that 
the Sixth Amendment is? 

MR. EDWARDS: Yes.

4 going back, if you continue talking, She 
5 has to type while you talk. 
6 MR, PIKE: The Sixth Amendment, as 
7 incorporated into the due process clause, 
8 which is the Fourteenth Amendment is the 
9 tight to effective assistance of counsel. 
10 MR. EDWARDS: I understand, | 
iL MR. PIKE: Ifyou read it in full, it 
12 will kind of shed light and you can probably 
13 glean the invocation and the meaning of it 
14 from his response, 
15 Is there a question? i 
16 MR. EDWARDS: Go back, please. | 
17 (The record was read.) 
18 Q So your counse! told you that you must

3 I'm going to instruct you not to answer 
4 that question, because [ don't understand | 
5 it. It was not your response, and 

6 because -- 

a MR, EDWARDS: I wrote down the response 
8 MR. PIKE: -- and because, if t 

9 understand, your question, you phrased it

1 as, "So if] understand you, your attorney 

iL told you," so I'm going to instruct you not

WW telling me already what -— 

18 MR. PIKE: That's not what he said. He 

19 said "On the advice of counsel."

telephone by Epstein, Sarah Kellen or other | 
unknown employees or assistants working for | 
Epstein, and were then persuaded to come rid 
Epstein's house for the purposes of engaging in 
prostitution.

the RICO allegations that were dismissed 

with prejudice, So, I just want to be 

clear, are you doing discovery on a count 

that no longer exists’?

client agrees with the assertion that's 

stated in the complaint, or if he has a 

defense that is going to defeat such

defeat such assertion. So I'm simply asking 

your client...

MR. EDWARDS: How are you instructing 
not to answer a question? 

MR, PIKE: Because I am. 

MR, EDWARDS: Based on what? 

MR. PIKE: Because it is harassing. 

MR. EDWARDS; I'm not harassing, 1 want 

to know why he did what he did, 

MR. PIKE: You are harassing him. 1 
mean, it is an argumentative question -~ { 
MR. EDWARDS: He harassed my clients. 

MR, PIKE: -- he has been hete since |

A Though I would like to answer that “i 
question, as well as most of your other questions 
here today, Mr. Bdwards, in fact, all of the | 
other questions here today, my counsel! has | 
instructed me at least today, F must assert my 
tights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendment. 

Q Mr. Epstein, did you use a telephone to 
knowingly persuade, induce or entice minor 
females, including Jane Doe, to engage in 
prostitution? 

MR. PIKE: Form, 

A Though I would like to answer that 
question, as wel] as your other questions today, 

Mr, Edwards, at least today, my counsel has | 
instructed me that I must assert my rights under | 
the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. | 

Q Mr. Epstein, did you travel, interstate { 
commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit 
sexual conduct with minor females, including Jai 
Doe? 

MR. PEE: Form, 

A_ Though I would like to answer that 

question, as well as the other questions youve 


counsel has instructed me that I must assert my 
rights under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth 
Amendment. 

Q Isn't it true that you agreed with the 
federal government that if Jane Doe brought 
claims exclusively alleging those sections of 18 j 
USC 2255 that I've read in the preceding, four | 
paragraphs, that you would admit liability unto j | 
her as an identified victim? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A. I don't believe that's what the document 
says, 

Q The document says, “if any of the | 
individuals referred to in paragraph 7 elects to 
file suit pursuant to 18 USC 2255, Epstein waives 
his right to contest liability, and also waives | 
his right to contest damages up to an amount as | 
agreed to between the identified individual and | 
Epstein, so long as the identified individual 
elects to proceed exclusively under 18 USC i 
2255." 

That's the provision. I'l ask you then 
the question: Didn't you agree with the federal | 
government that if Jane Doe, an identified 
victim, proceeds in a case against you, i

exclusively under 18 USC 2258, that you waived 
your right to contest liability? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Also, could call for 

the disclosure of attorney/client 

communications and work product, and is 

protected under the Federal Rule of Evidence 

502408, as well as 410? 

A Though I would like to answer that 
question, Mr. Edwards, I have to invoke my rights 
under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Ina recent motion for summary judgment 
filed on your behalf, 2 statement is made, 
"Epstein never using a facility or means of 
interstate commerce, knowingly persuaded, indnes 
or enticed Jane Doe when she was under the age of 
18 years, to engage in prostitution or sexual 
activity for which any person can be charged with 
a criminal offense or attempted to do so." That 
is a false statement, true? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A. Though I would like to answer that 
question, on advice of counsel I have been 
instructed to assert my rights under the Sixth, 
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q The statement was also made on your 








476 
behalf, "Epstein never attempted to or conspired 
to knowingly transport Jane Doe in interstate or 
foreign commerce or in any Commonwealth territ 
or possession of the United States, with intent 
that Jane Dee engage in prostitution or in any 
sexual activity for which any person can be 
charged with a criminal offense.” 
That is also a false statement; isn’t 
that right? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. You said “Jane Doe.” 
Q Jane Doe is Jane Boe in this case, 
MR, PIKE; Form, 

A. believe her deposition speaks to 
that. With respect to anything else, | have to 
assert my rights under the Sixth, Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q You betieve that Jane Doe's deposition 
speaks to whether you attempted or conspired to 
knowingly transfer Jane Doe in interstate 
commerce, correct? 

MR. PIKE: Fonn, 

Q You believe her deposition speaks to 
that? 

A That's my belief, yes.

Q And then would you adopt her deposition

A You're asking her entire deposition. 
testimony? 

Q The deposition as it relates to whether 
or not you knowingly transported her in 
interstate commerce, 

A Well, | would like to answer that 
question, but on advice of counsel, at least 
today, I have been instructed to assert my rights 
under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q A statement that Epstein never attempted 
te or conspired to travel in interstate commerce| 
or travel into the United States or travel in 
foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in 
illicit sexual conduct with Jane Doe," is also a 
false statement, isn't it? 

MR. PIKE: Form? 

A_ lL would like to answer that question as 
well as your other questions, Mr. Edwards. 
However, today my counsel has instructed me that 
I must assert my Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendment right. 


478 


Q The statement that Epstein never 
attempted to or conspired to travel in foreign 
commerce and engage in any illicit sexual conduct 
with Jane Doe, is also a false statement; isn't 
that right? 

MR. PIKE: Form, 

A T would like to that question as well as 
the other questions posed today, Mr. Edwards. 
However, on the advice of counsel they've 
instructed me fo assert my Sixth, Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendment right. 

Q In fact, you did contact Jane Doe when 
she was a minor child as well as conspired to use 
a telephone to contact Jane Doe when she was a 
minor child, specifically for the purposes of 
engaging in illicit sexual conduct with Jane Doe, 
true? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Though I would like to answer that 
question as well as your other questions posed 
here today, Mr. Edwards, I have been instructed 
by my counsel thet I must assert my rights under 
the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Did you intentionally touch Jane Doe on 
her person and against ber will or without her 





legal consent? 
MR, PIKE: One second... Form. 

A Without her legal consent? 

Q Yes. 

A Can you tell me what that means? 

Q Ia order to answer that question, I need 
te explain to you what legal consent means? 

A Yes, sir. 

Q Let's start with this question -- 

A Can you explain it to me? 

Q Do you believe that a 14-year old child 
can legally consent to sexual interaction with a} 
man like you that was over the age of 50? 

MR. PIKE: Form, 
THE WITNESS: Asking for a legal... 
MR. PIKE: Go ahead and invoke? 

A I would like to answer that question, if 
L understood it correctly. However, my attorneys 
have advised me today at least to invoke my 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right, 

MR. PIKE: And J think you skipped over 

a question because you went from the first 

question, and the witness was ~- 

MR. EDWARDS: Asking for a definition? 
MR. PIKE: Asking for a definition, so 


480 


he could properly interpret your question 

and attempt to answer it. 

Q I'm understanding that, based on your 
answer, that my question, “Did you intentional 
touch Jane Doe without her legal consent?" And 
your response, depends on the definition of 
“legal consent;" is that true? 

MR, PIKE: | think that the witness -- 

as people regularly do as deponents, ask for 

clarification of a question, and Mr. Epstein 

asked you to clarify what, “legal consent" 
was. [fyou wish to do that, then I guess 

he could potentially understand your 

question. However, if you don’t want to do 

that, then I guess we can just move on, 

Q This will provide the answer: How old 
was Jane Doe when you touched her? 

MR. PIKE: Form. Assumes facts not in 
evidence. 

A [-- 1-1 don't know how to answer 
that question. I'll have to assert my Fifth 
Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment right. 

Q Tell me why you're having trouble 
answering the question and F'll clarify the

questions that you've posed here today regarding 
Jane Doe, on advice of counsel, at least today, 
they've instructed me I nrust assert my rights

Q Mr. Epstein, did you coerce Jane Doe 
into prostitution? 

A ... Again? 

Q Did you coerce Jane Doe into 
prostitution? 

A Can you tell me what you mean by 
“coerce,” please? 

Q Tellme, baw did you — 

A I've asked you a simple question. Can 
you telf me what "coerce" means, please? 

Q The definition of the word "coerce" will 
allow to you answer that question? 

A_ i'm trying to understand the question. 

MR. PIKE: You're using -- for the 

record, you're using i¢gal terms. 

"Consent," "coerce." Those are the terms 

you're utilizing in your question. Mr. 





38 (Pages 481 to 484) 


U.S. Legal Support 
(561) 835-0220 









485 


Epstein is simply asking you what those 
terms mean in order to facilitate a response | 
or 4 response coupled with the invocations. | 
He doesn't -- he is not a lawyer. He 

doesn't understand these legal terms, and he 
is asking you for clarification. If you 

want to take those legal terms out of your 
questions and simplify them, then go ahead 
and do that, but it is fair that he ask what 
certain words mean, 

MR. EDWARDS: | absolutely agree and 
want to make sure before | give him the ' 
definition, that this question is being 
asked because the definition will help him 
to accurately answer the question, assuming 
that would be the only reason he would ask 
me a question. 

MR. PIKE: As his lawyer, I think that 
the definition of the word would assist him 
in understanding the question a little bit 
better, because, as you know, "coerce" and 
"consent" have several meanings, whether on 
not it be in State court, under the Florida 
State statutes or under federal statutes 
under 2255. | think that any sort of 


|

response could, you know... tiptoe into the 

Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth, and 1 think Mr. 

Epstein is attempting to... understand your 

questions. 

MR. EDWARDS: 1 appreciate that. I feel 
like we're getting closer to an answer than 

we have received during this entire 

litigation, so I'm certainly going to help 

him out here. 

Q Mr. Epstein, do you then at least agree 
that you paid Jane Doe money in exchange for 
sexual services when she was under the age of 
18? 

MR. PIKE: Form, mischaracterizes the 
witness's testimony, and move to strike. 

A. Unfortunately I have to answer that 
question as I've answered most of your other 
questions here today, Mr. Edwards, which is that + 
my attorneys, at least today, have advised me 
that J must assert my rights under the Sixth, 

Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Mr, Epstein, how did you, meaning what 
process did you go through, to get Jane Doe to 
exchange your money for her sexual services when 
she was under the age of 18?

which I think he wants you to follow up wit 
a question. 

MR. EDWARDS: It is just placed on the 
table. I'm waiting for an answer. 

MR. PIKE: I'm not being smarter, I'm 
just saying, are you going to follow through 
with the question that's currently on the 
table or the one that -- 

MR. EDWARDS: 1 asked a question and 
many waiting for an answer. 

MR. PIKE: Seriously, I'm not trying to 
be rude or smart. You put an exhibit in

MR, HOROWITZ: | wanted to give the 
court reporter the exhibits. She gets the 
exhibits, 

MR. PIKE: I've got to know what

quotes, "work"? 
MR. PIKE: Waitasecond. Form, lacks | 
predicate, foundation, and for the record, 
you're referring to a stack of documents | 
that have not been marked -~ ; 
MR. EDWARDS; Not referring to anything, | 
just so that your objection is clear, 
MR. PIKE: You're referring to what I 
see as a stack of documents that look like 
message pads. You're clarifying and... 
making a prelude into your question as to i 
why were underage girls calling your home 
for work? 
MR. EDWARDS: Right. 
MR. PIKE: You're not allowing the 
witness to see the exhibits to which you | 
refer, and I think itis an improper | 
question and lacks predicate and 
foundation. | 

MR, EDWARDS: No matter what I show thé 
witness, any answer he gives is going to 
incriminate him, so he is going to invoke i 
his Fifth Amendment rights, which is why | 
right now, he is not going to see these. At 
trial he will see all of these things. 





MR. PIKE: I'm glad you said that. 1 
think that's a false statement. I move to 
strike it. Mr. Edwards, you provided a. 
document to Mr, Epstcin not two minutes ago 
and he answered questions without invoking 
the Fifth Amendinent right. 

MR. EDWARDS: And it incriminated him. 

MR. PIKE: If the Fifth Amendment comes 
into play. 

MR. EDWARDS: It should have. 

MR. PIKE: Thank you. If the Fifth 
Amendment comes into play, he will invoke 
the Fifth. He does not know certain 
information. Not knowing something, my 
friend, is not a waiver. Follow? So he is 
trying to -- 

MR. EDWARDS: It is ~ 

MR. PIKE: -- trying to actually work 
with you on your questions. Maybe if you 
show him what you're talking about, he can 
answer your question, 

Q Why were underage minor femaies cating 
your honse to, quote, unquote, “work”? 

MR, PIKE: Form. 

A Unfortunately, I have to answer that

question, as I've answered most of your other 
questions here today, Mr. Bdwards, which is that 
my attorneys advised me to assert my Sixth 
Amendment, Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment right. 

Q Do you knew Adriana Mucinska or Adria 
Ross? 

A. As!'ve answered most of your other 
questions here today, I'm going to have to 
respond that my attorneys have instructed me io 
assert my rights to the Sixth, Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q That's somebody who is listed in the 
agreement between yourself and the United States 
of America as a co-conspirator of yours. Does 
that help refresh your recollection as to who Ms. 
Ross ts? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A I'm going to bave to respond by 
asserting my rights to the Sixth, Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Do you remember receiving messages from 
Adriana that would read something like, "Hlefta 
message for Ashley to confirm for 11:00 o'clock 
and Vanessa for 4:30, 











many messages like that? 


MR, PIKE: Fm sorry, but before he 
answers, I'm just curious, you're again 
referring to a stack of documents that's 
about an inch thick. Do you want to mark 
anything as an exhibit? 

MR. EDWARDS: No, I really don't, Mike, 
but appreciate all the help you're 
providing. Thanks. 

MR. PIKE: Yeah. You're welcome. Do 
you know where these documents came from’ 

MR. EDWARDS: Yes. 

MR. PIKE: Where did you obtain that 
them from? 

MR. EDWARDS; It is not my deposition. 
You had that chance already. 

MR. PIKE: No, | asked the right -- no, 
that's not really part of my case over 
there. Critton took your depesition, not 
me. That's a case separate and distinct 
from these cases, so my question to you is: 
I'm just curious, you have a stack of 
documents, I think you said earlier they 
came from the State Attorney's Office file? 

MR. EDWARDS: It is not my deposition. 
I'm asking questions. Your client is going

article that you just questioned him, Could 

you please, for the record, provide the 

title to the first article. 

MR. EDWARDS: I did. 
MR. PIKE: I didn't hear it. 
MR. EDWARDS: I will do it again. "A 

Return Of A "Very Passionate’ Jeffrey 

Epstein." 

MR. PEKE: Thank you. 

MR, EDWARDS: “Very passionate” is in 
quotes, as I said the first time. 

MR, PIKE; Thank you. 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the video 

record 3:02 p.m, 

(Pause in the proceedings.) 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the video 

record at 3:15 p.m. 

Q In the same articte, "The Fanaticist," 
there is @ quote by "Michael Wolff." Do you =" 
Michael Wolff, the columnist? 

A Ihave to respond the same way I've 
responded fo most of your questions here today, 
which is, | must assert my rights under the 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Mr Wolff says i ina | guote i in this 


article, “He has never," speaking about Mr. 
Epstein, "been secretive about the girls. Atone | 
point when his troubles began he was talking to 
me and said, ‘What can I say? I like young 
girls,'" Is that a comment or statement that you 
made to Michael Wolff? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. Unfortunately I have to respond to that 
question as f did to most of your questions 
today, which is I must assert my rights under 
advice of counsel, under the Sixth, Fifth and | 
Fourteenth Amendment. | 
Q On several occasions your attorney or | 
one of your attorneys, Jack Goldberger, has made 
the statement "Jeffrey Epstein has never denied 
that the girls came to the house." Are you 
admitting that the girly that are now plaintiffs, 
at least came to your house? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. I would like to answer that question 
you've just quoted an attorney's statement? 
Q Right, Jack Geldberger’s statement. 
A So what's the question? 
MR. PIKE: You can't -- hold on right 
there. This is ridiculous, This is getting 





to be ridiculous. You can't read -- 

MR. EDWARDS: What -- 

MR. PIKE: You can't read someone else's 
quote and say "Are you admitting something 
from someone else's quote." He didn't make 
the quote, so how can it be an admission, 
despite who it is. 

MR. HOROWITZ: That's a form objection, 

MR. PIKE: You're right, form. 

Q Your attorney, Jack Goldberger, made ¢ 
statement, "Jeffrey Epstein never denied the 
girls came to the house." This was related to 
the criminal investigation of you. 

Do you admit that the girls, 

specifically Jane Doe, came to your house? 

A Mr. Edwards, J would like to respond to 
that question as I responded to most of the other 
questions today, but unfortunately my counsel has 
advised me I must assert my rights under the 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Mr. Epstein, can you tell the jury who 
Sarah Kellen is? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Unfortunately, Mr. Edwards, I have to 
Tespond to that question as I responded to most 


524 


of your other questions today, because on advice 
of counsel they've instructed me to assert my 
tights under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth 
Amendment, 

Q You're aware that she is somebody sted 
as a co-conspirator of yours related to your 
criminal activity in the Nonprosecution 
Agreement, correct? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A With respect to that question as most of 
your other questions here today, on advice of 
counsel I have been instructed to assert my 
rights under the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth 
Amendment, 

Q Isn't it érue that you paid her to have 
underage minor femafes brought to your house, 
specific times, as you directed? 

MR. PIKE: Form, asked and answered. 

A As I've answered most of your questions 
here today, unfortunately my counsel has advised. 
me that 1 must assert my rights under the Sixth, 
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment.

is labeled in the Nonprosecution Agreement, is

Horowitz on Monday, March 8th of this year, You

of your questions and will continue fo answer on 
advice of counsel, } believe, this question, I 
have to assert my Fifth Amendment, Fourteenth 
Aniendment and Sixth Amendment rights under the 
U.S. Constitution." 

If you were asked the same question 
today, what would your answer be? That question 
wast "Do you acknowledge that Jane Dee 103 has 


been to your ome"? 


A. Please tell me who Jane Doe 103 is. 

Q Fane Doe 103 is Jane Doe 103. 

A. I would like to answer the question so 
the answer would be the same. 

MR. PIKE: By “answering that question,” 
you're invoking Fifth, Sixth and 

Fourteenth? 

THE WITNESS: Yes. 
MR, PIKE: Please do so. 

A I'm invoking my Sixth Amendment, Fifth 
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right. 

Q You were then asked "Do you acknowledge 
that Jane Doe 103 came to your home for sexual 
contact during her childhood and that you paid 
her for those services?" 

Mr. Pike said "Form, predicate, 
foundation, argumentative,” and your response wah 
“I would like to answer that question. I think 
those questions will all have obvious answers,

MR. PIKE: And Ms. Ezell, let me caution 
you that I've listened to several of your 
questions. The first one being a repetition 
of Mr. Horowitz's question approximately 
four weeks ago dealing with your client 103, 
so | did not have a problem with that 
background information being repeated. 
However, it seems that the questions that 
you're discussing now and going over are 
just a repetition of Mr. Horowitz's 
background information, which has already 
been established and really has no relation, 
in my opinion, to your particular clients. 

Given the fact we are here today, Mr. 
Horowitz has taken the liberty of concluding) 
his deposition, obviously with rebuttal 


available, same with Mr. Edwards, J would | 


ask, rather than to have to seek assistance 
of the Court, that your questions be 
tailored toward your client. 

MS. EZELL: Mr. Pike, I would beg to 
differ with you. Questions regarding his 
sexual interests, including digitally 
penetrating vaginas of girls between ages of 





MR. PIKE: Ms. Ezell, you were at that 
deposition. You cross-noticed that 
deposition and these cases have been 
consolidated for discovery, and you have not 
formed, with the exception of one question, 
since you commenced your portion of the 
depo, you have not formed one question 
relative to your particular client, 

You just asked a general question that 
had already been asked by Mr. Horowitz who 
commenced the Volume | of this Volume III o 
TV continuation of the deposition. If you 
want to tailor these questions to your 
client, | have no problem with that, but to 
ask the same exact question Mr. Horowitz 
asked who commenced the deposition is a 
waste of time, 

MS. EZELL: That may be your opinion, 
Mr. Pike, but I believe I have, particularly 
in the way these questions were answered 
five weeks ago, that today, that day he was. 
unable to answer because of advice of 
counsel. I certainly have the right to ask 
his whether this day, five weeks later, he 
can answer that question.

MR. HOROWITZ: I join in Ms. Ezell's 
comments. 

MR. EDWARDS: Agreed. 

MR. PIKE: Thank you, Three against 
one. Nonetheless, again, 1 hold steadfast 
the same argument. It is repetitious and 
whether or not -- he is not going to waive 
Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth yesterday and he| 
is not going to waive it today, so... 

MS. EZELL: That's fine. My objection 
to that is that it is misleading for him to 
say that “Today I have been instructed not 
to answer it,” because then I come here 
hoping five weeks later I may get an answer, 
and unfortunately that's not been the case. 
We have had the same invocation of the 
privileges today, only today, just for 
today. 

MR. PIKE: Well, I 

MS. EZELL: I'm done with that line of 
questioning. 

MR. PIKE: Okay. 

MS. EZELL: But I think { had the right 
to ask. 

MR. PIKE: Thank you, 








540 


MS, BZELL: Thank you.

United States? 

A Yes. 

Q And are you a citizen of the United

Q Ofwhat State or territory of the United 
States are you a citizen? 

A I'ma citizen of the United States,

A I'm acitizen of the United States, 

Q Where do you vote? 

A Lyvote in the Virgin Islands.

Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q And 1 would just note that your tax 
returns are public documents available to the 
government, and there is no -- no risk of 
incriminating yourself with such a document. D 
you still maintain the same objection?

it is back under appeal. 

Q Before serving your jail time in Patm 
Beach County, followed by your community contrel 
time, was your principal place of residence the 
dwelling in Manhattan? 

A The what? 

Q Your mansion ia Manhattan? 

MR. PIKE: Form, 

A I'm sorry, but at least today, F would 
like to answer all your questions, Ms. Ezell. 
However, on advice of counsel I will have to 
respond by invoking my Sixth, Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q lL won't repeat the same questions 
regarding the plan or scheme. I'll try not to, 
that have already been covered today. To the 
extent that they didn't just apply to that one 
plaintiff, in most instances, I believe that Mr. 
Edwards said, "young women" or "young girls li 
or including Jane Doe," but there were a few 
additional questions in that area | wanted to 
ask, 


542 


‘Within that arrangement whereby girls i 
would come or be brought to your home to provide 
massages and other sexual gratification fer you, | 
were they often brought by taxis that were paid 
for by you or by someone on your behalf? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Though I would like to answer ali your 
questions today, Ms. Ezell, I'm going to have to 
respond fo that question as I've responded to 
most of your other questions, which is, on advice 
of counsel, at feast today, they've instructed me 
to assert my rights as protected by the Sixth, 

Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Also, within that same scheme, were 
these girls sometimes fransported to or from your | 
house by the current houseman employed by you at} 
that time? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Though I would like to answer all your 
questions, Ms. Ezell, that question as weil as 
the others, | must unfortunately at least today, 
on advice of counsel, invoke my Sixth Amendment, | 
Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right. 

Q And again following with that plan as 
discussed previously, were these same young womel 





543 


who came to your home to provide massages and 
other sexual gratification for you, were they 
often transported by Sarah Kellen or other 
assistants that you employed? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Though I would like to answer each and 
every one of your questions, Ms. Ezell, I 
respectfully must decline. On advice of counsel 
they've instructed me I must assert my rights 
protected by the Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth 
Amendment. 

Q Would you acknowledge, Mr. Epstein, that 
once the girls were there, beginning with their 
first experience, their first visit, there was a 
sort of a ritual that was followed in regard to 
how they were treated, what they were asked to di 
and what occurred? 

MR. PIKE: I'm sorry, I didn't know if 
that was the question. 

MS. EZELL: It is a question. 

THE WITNESS: What's the question? 

MR. PIKE: What is the question? 

Q From the first visit a girl might make 
to your home, was there a ritual or routine that 


was followed with regard te what happened durin 


544 
that visit? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Ms. Ezell, 1 would like it answer all 
your questions that you posed here today, but I 
wilt have to respond unfortunately, as I've 
responded to most of the others which is, my 
counsel advised me I must respond by invoking my 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q For instance, in addition to the other 
things that Mr. Edwards and Mr. Horowitz ask 
about, within the same area, would Ms. Kelten or} 
one of your other assistants usually go up and 
Jay out the towels and particular massage olls 
that you like? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Ms. Ezell, unfortunately I have to 
answer that question as I've answered most of 
your other questions here today, respectfully 
decline to answer on advice of counsel who's

have to assert my rights as protected by the 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Did it occur quite often that Sarah

and the girl who brought her would go up to your 
bedroom and massage area with her, on her initial 
visit? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Again? Can you -- what's the question? 

Q I'm asking about whether or not there 
was 8 sort of routine that was followed when the 


girls would come to your home to provide the 
massages and other sexual gratification for you, 
I'm asking whether or not part of that routine 
was that they would be accompanied by the girl 
who brought them? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A. I'm going to have to, on advice of 
counsel, answer that question by asserting my 
rights as protected by the Sixth, Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendment.

brought them, would it be your usual practice td 
allow them to start the massage and then excuse’ 
the girl who had brought the second girl for her! 
first visit? |

the girls or instruct the girls to remove their 
clothing?

massaged, would you then typically turn over, 
exposing yourself, laying on your back?

have to decline to answer that question today, 
because my counsel has asked me to assert my 
Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and Fourteer 
Amendment right, though I would like to answer 
every one of your questions. 

Q Would it be your practice at that point, 
depending on the skittishness of the girl to

question?

trying to work with you, Ms. Ezelf, but that 
is an exact question that Mr. Horowitz 
asked at the commencement of the 
deposition. We are back in generalities 
again, and it is repetitious. If you could, 
Ict's try to narrow it to your client. 
MS. EZELL: I'm certainly entitled to 
see how my client fits into the big picture 
or my clients, and whether this was part of 
@ pattern and whether they indeed were 
‘treated according to a pattern or scheme or

explanation. 





THEREUPON, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
being by Terri Becker first duly sworn to tell 
the whole truth, as hereinafter certified, 
testified as follows: 
DIRECT EXAMINATION 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q Can you give us your name, 

A Jeffrey Epstein. 

Q Mr. Epstein, you made a comment when you 
came in the room that you were appreciative of me 
being respectful to your housekeeper yesterday 
and | intend for that to be the same with you 
today. 

J want to start by asking you, at this 
point we've gone through a lot of discovery in 
this case. There aren't many disputed facts as 
to what actually happened at your house, 
Generally I think you would agree that you 
derived a way for young females to come to your 
house and engage in varying degrees of sexual 
activity, some of the girls as young as 12, some 
of them as old as seventeen or so, most in 
between, but as of yet you haven't provided an 


I want to provide you an opportunity to 

tell the jury at this time why you did it. 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to object. 

Confusing, compound and irrelevant, as 

worded. 

A You know, I would Jike to answer that 
question, frankly. However, at this time, my 
attorneys have told me that I can't and [ must 
invoke my Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment 
tights or 1 risk losing their counse). 

Accordingly, I therefore assert those rights. 
Sorry. 

MR. PIKE; In addition to that I'll move 
to strike counsel's statement as a 
narrative, as well. 

MR. EDWARDS: I understand. I wanted to 
provide him an opportunity, if today was 
going to be the day. 

MR. PIKE: Same thing, move to strike, 

Q Mr. Epstein, how long have you been 
sexually attractive to underage minor females? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, harassing, 
argumentative. 

A Are you kidding? 

Q No, I mean, I don't feel like I'm

divulging any secrets here, right? 
MR. PIKE: Move to strike. 

Q That's the question that's pending. 

A_ [would like to answer that question as 
well, as all your other questions today, however, 
I have to follow my attorneys' advice. They have 
told me J must invoke my Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment right to not answer those 
questions today, or any questions relevant to 
this lawsuit, so accordingly, I'm going to assert 
those rights and -- under the constitution 
guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth, and Fourteenth 
atnendment. 

Q Would you consider yourself addicted to 
sex with minor females? 

MR, PIKE: Same objections. 

A You know, Mr. Edwards, again, I want to 
be very respectful. As the current U.S. Attorney 
has described your law firm as a criminal 
enterprise and part of one of the largest frauds 
in Florida's history, it has been reported that 
your firm has fabricated multiple cases against 
me in order to fleece unsuspecting investors out 
of millions and millions of dollars, so 


_ unfortunately at this time, although I would like _ 


to answer that question, on advice of counsel 1 
will have to refrain and assert my Fifth, Sixth 
and Fourteenth Amendment right, 

Q Can you then provide an explanation for 
what relevance that soliloquy of yours has fo, 
whether or not you engaged in sex acts with L.M. 
‘When she was a minor? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, no, he cannot. 
Argumentative. Compound, harassing. 

MR. EDWARDS: Mr. Pike, with all due 
respect, it was not my idea for him to give 
this speech about a former RRA law firm L 
was asking to elaborate on that. 

MR. PIKE; Counsel, I'm working with 
your follow-up question. 

MR. EDWARDS; [ understand. 

MR. PIKE: I'm objecting, object to the 
form and stating the reasons on the record 
why the form is required to be objected to, 
based upon your question. 

MR. EDWARDS: Will he elaborate on the 
relevance of that soliloquy to his touching 
L.M. when she was 13, 14 and 15 years old in 
asexual manner? 

MR, PIKE: I'm going to object again,

Q You cau answer, 

A Twould like to answer, however, f'm 
going to have to assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth 
Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment right as advised 
by my counsel, otherwise I risk losing their 
advice. 

Q Mr. Epstein, have you ever been 
diagnosed with a sex addiction to minors by a 
psychologist or other medical professional? 

A Lintend to respond to all of your 
questions at some relevant time; however, today 
at the present time, my attorneys have counseled 
me that I cannot provide answers to any questions 
relevant to this lawsuit and I nist accept their 
advice or tisk losing my Sixth Amendment rights 
to effective representation, 

Accordingly, I assert my Fifth, 
Federal -- Fifth and Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendinent rights, to the United States 
Constitution. 

MR. PIKE: In addition to that, Mr. 

Edwards, as the Court has ruled on several 
___ matters, Mr, Epstein's medical bistory is 





not relevant at this time nor has he placed 

same at issue in this case. 

MR. EDWARDS: Understood, 

Q Mr, Epstein, were you sexually abused as 
a minor? 

A Again? 

Q Were you sexually abused, as a minor? 

A You know, again, I would like to respond 
to all -- if any questions seem to be relevant. 

T would like to respond to any relevant question 
at this time; however, my attorneys have 
counseled me that [ cannot provide answers to the 
questions relevant to this lawsuit today. I must 
accept their advice or risk losing my Sixth 
Amendment right to effective representation. 
Accordingly then, I assert my Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment right to the United States 
Constitution. 

Q Isn't it true that you have engaged in 
some sexual interaction with hundreds of underage 
minor females in the last ten years of your 
life? Is that true? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, relevance, 

A Mr. Edwards, the current U.S. Attorney 

has described your law firm a3 a criminal 


3 {Pages 6 to 9) 


U.S. Legal Support 
(561) 835-0220 








enterprise and part of the largest fraud in 
Florida's bistory. It has been reported that 

your firm fabricated multiple cases, many, many 
multiple cases against me in order to fleece 
unsuspecting investors out of millions and 
millions of dollars. Unfortunately, at this time 
in response to your question, my attorneys have 
advised me that I must assert my Sixth Amendment, 
Fifth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment right. 
Though, i believe, you know, that I would really 
like to answer your questions today, but at this 
moment I must assert those rights or risk having 
my attorneys resign. 

Q You're invoking your Fifth Amendment 
rights to each of these questions because you 
know your answers will incriminate you and you 
feel it will result in you being prosecuted for 
your crimes; isn't that right? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
harassing. Calls for a legal conclusion. 

Q You can answer. 

A No, in fact, the Supreme Court recently 
said the Fifth Amendment right is there to 
protect the innocent, so, that’s the way 1 would 
Like bo answer that 


Q Are you actuaily telling the jury that 
you didn't commit the crimes that have been 
alleged against you by the various females that 
were under age when you engaged in sex with 
them? Are you telling the jury that right now? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
harassing. 

A. I would like to respond to that 
question, as you know, however, at the present 
time my attorneys have counseled me that I cannot 
provide answers to any questions relevant to this 
lawsuit and I must accept their advice or risk 
losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation. Accordingly, | assert my Fifth, 
Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right under the 
United States Constitution. 

Q Mr. Epstein, you understand that this is 
the video that will be played to the jury in 
L.M.'s trial against you and L.M. wants answers. 
‘The jury is going to want answers, so I know that 
your're telling us that you're going to respond at 
some time in the fature; but the time is now. 
Would you like this opportunity ¢o explain why 
you engaged in sexual activity with L.M. 





beginning when she was 13 years old and you were) 


50 years old? 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to object once 
again. We are getting way too argumentative 
with the questioning. The questioning is 
compound. It is speculative and it is also 
harassing. Whether or not this deposition 
video, thereof is played in front of a jury 
is a question of fact, and it will be 
determined by a judge pursuant to a motion 
in Jimine, various portions thereof may or 
may not be played, so having placed those 
objections on the record I'm going to 
instruct Mr. Epstein not to answer that 
question. 

MR. EDWARDS: Mr. Pike, I don't know if 
you watched the 13 hours of harassing 
questions to L.M., that she sometimes 
invoked her Fifth Amendment rights, I 
understand the adverse advice that would be 
given and she was made to answer these 
questions and these exact same questions 
were asked of her, in fact, I'm using the 
phraseology from Mr, Luttier. I'm not 
trying to harass him. 
Q_Fm simply asking him to explain to the_ 

13 


jury. If you're saying it didn't happen, if 
you're saying it did happen, explain to the jury 
why you did it. That's ail I want to hear, I'm 
being respectful about this. 

MR. PIKE: In an effort to keep a clean 
record be respectful to the to the court 
reporter rather than having a diatribe back 
and forth between you and myself, I'll move 
to strike your last statement as 
irrelevant. Let's move on. 

Q Is it true, Mr. Epstein, you were born 
January 20, 1953? 

A Yes. 

Q Where? 

A New York. 

Q Where in New York? 

A Brooklyn. 

Q Did you go to high school there? 

A Yes, sir. 

Q Where? 

A_ Lafayette High School. 

Q After high scheol did you attend 
college? 

A Yes. 

@ Where was that?

New York. 

What college did you attend? 
Cooper Union. 

Sorry, I didn't hear, 

Cooper Union. 


No, sir. 
How many years were you in college? 
I believe, two. 
What did you study? 
Physics. 
Why did you leave college early? 
] intend to respond to all relevant 
questions regarding this lawsuit, however, at the 
present time my attorneys have counseled me that 
J cannot provide answers to questions that may be 
relevant to this lawsuit, so accordingly I assert 
my constitutional rights as guaranteed by the 
Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Are you invoking your Fifth Amendment 
rights as to why you left college, is it safe 
then to presume that that answer you believe 
would incriminate you in some way? 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to move to strike, 
Speculative, argumentative, harassing. 


FOPrPOFrFOrPOrO > O> 





Calls for a legal conclusion, and I know 
exactly what you're trying to do here, Mr. 
Edwards, is lace the record with questions 
that would ultimately give you an adverse 
inference at any potential trial of this 
matter, so having put that on the record, 

I'm going to instruct him not to answer that 
question, based upon his Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights to the United 
States Constitution, 

MR. EDWARDS: With all due respect you 
cannot invoke his Fifth Amendment rights, 
your attorneys instructed me in that fact -- 

MR. PIKE: He can. 

MR. EDWARDS: That L.M. Had to do it 
herself, so, [ would fike to hear it from 
Mr. Epstein. 


Q Can we assume you're invoking your Fifth 


Amendment rights as to why you left college 
early, that that answer you fee! would 
incriminate you? 

MR. PIKE: Once again, move to strike 
for the same reasons, 

‘You can answer. 
A I've already answered the question, 


Did you get a degree from Cooper Union? |

1¢ 


I'll restate the answer. 1 would like to 
respond, intend to respond, and would like to 
respond to all questions today. However, counsel 
has advised me I must take the Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment right under the U.S, 
Constitution. 

Q After college where were you employed? 

A_ You know, I would like to respond fo all 
your questions today, however, on advice of 
counsel, [ intend to take the Fifth, Sixth and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights provided by the 
United States Constitution or risk losing my 
counsel's representation, 

Q Isn't it true that you were a teacher at 
the Dalton School in New York after college? 

A. Again, I would like to respond to all 
your questions; however, my attorneys have 
counseled me that J cannot provide answers to any 
questions today regarding to this lawsuit so [ 
must accept their advice or risk losing my Sixth 
Amendment tight to effective representation. 
Accordingly, I assert my Constitutional rights as 
guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendment of the constitution. 
2M, Epstein, did you haye sex with any 

17 


underage students while teaching at the Dalton 
School? 

A Could you repeat that? 

Q Yes, Did you have sex with any underage 
students while teaching at the Dalton School in 
New York? 

A. Mr. Edwards, your firm has been 
described by the U.S. Attorney as one of the 
largest -- as a criminal enterprise, perpetrating 
one of the largest frauds in Florida's history. 

It has been reported that your firm fabricated 
multiple cases against me and others in order to 
fleece unsuspecting investors out of millions and 
millions of doilars. 








Unfortunately at this time in response. 

to your question, my attorneys have advised me 1 
must assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment 
and Fourteenth Amendment rights, though I believe 
you know I would like -- really like to answer 
your questions but at this time ] must assert 
those rights or have my attorneys resign. 

MR. EDWARDS: Mr. Pike, I think you know 
he has a couple of options here. He can 
answer questions or he can invoke his Fifth 
Amendment rights. This nonresponsive.

verbiage regarding the RRA law firm is not 

one of the options, it’s inappropriate in 

the deposition and I would ask you to

portion of his answer. I understand what he

take it up with the Court with the motion

the United States Attorney in South Florida as a 
criminal enterprise purported to -- purported to 
have put -- pulled off the largest fraud in 
Florida's history, 1 would like to answer it, 
however, my attomeys here today counseled me I 
must assert my Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution, 
therefore I'm going to do that. 

Q Are you saying because Rothstein, 
Rosenfeld, Adler was determined fo be a criminal 
enterprise or somebody was running @ criminal | 
enterprise out of that law firm, that is the i 
reason why you are not going to answer these | 
questions today? You linked that together in \

what the relationship between Rothstein, 
Rosenfeld, Adler is to you invoking your Fifth 
Amendment rights today, if you can articulate 
that for me. 

MR. PIKE: Form, compound, 
argumentative. | 

A Rothstein, Rosenfeld, Adler has been ! 
described by the U.S. Attorney as a criminal | 
enterprise and as part of the largest fraud in | 
Florida's history. It has been reported that | 
your firm fabricated multipie cases using me, and

cases of a sexual nature against me and others. 
Unfortunately, although would like to answer

Q Ist true, Mr. Epstein, that you and 
Ghislaine Maxwell forced V.R. to have sex with

MR. PIKE; Form, argumentative, 

harassing, 

A Unfortunately at this time, though 1 
would really like to answer those questions, and 
like I have done for most of your questions here 
‘today, Mr. Edwards, your firm was described as a. 
criminal enterprise, a serious criminal 
enterprise by the current U.S, Attorney. Part of 
that criminal enterprise was fabricating cases sof = 

37 


a sexual nature against me and others in order to 
fleece unsuspecting investors out of millions of

matter how I would like to respond to your 
questions, I must assert my Sixth Amendment, 

Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights 
under the U.S, Constitution or risk having my 
attorneys resign. 

Q Isn't it true that V.R. was yours and 
Ghislaine Maxwell's sex slave from the time she 
was 15 through the time she escaped when she was

argumentative, harassing. 

A Mr, Edwards, your firm has been 
described as - excuse me, as a criminal 
enterprise by the current U.S. Attorney and part 
of the largest fraud in Florida's history. Part 
of that fraud was fabricating multiple cases 
against people like me and others, of a sexual 
nature, in order to fleece unsuspecting investors

Amendment right. 

Q Isn't it true that you and Ghislaine 
Maxwell celebrated her 16th birthday with her and 
had sex with her on that day? 

MR. PEKE: Form. Compound, confusing, 
argumentative, harassing, 

A Mr, Edwards, [ would like to answer that 
question. My attorneys have told me today, I 
have to at least today assert my Fifth Amendment, 
Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights 
to the U.S. Constitution, especially my concern 
is, thet your firm has filed fraudulent lawsuits, 
fabricated lawsuits, and the U.S. Attorney, the 
current U.S, Attorney has described your firm as 
acriminal enterprise that -- whose main purpose 
was to generate money for the firm and its 
co-conspirators through the operation of various 
criminal activities, including mail fraud, wire 
fraud and money laundering. 

Q Are you saying that the complaint of 
L.M. against you, the allegation in that 
complaint, are false? 

MR. PIKE: Form. Misinterprets the 
witness's testimony. 
gitis true? 


MR, PIKE: Same objection. 

Q Itis either true or false? 

A_ TH repeat myself, unfortunately, but 
the current U.S. Attorney has described your law 
firm that filed that filed L.M.‘s claim -- was 
involved in the filing of L.M.'s claim, 
motions — I'm sorry, do you want to tell me what 
it was then? Would you like to tell me the 
firm's involvement in this lawsuit, since we will 
be here the rest of the day? 

Q Answer the question, 

A Allright. 

The U.S. Attorney has described that 

firm as a criminal enterprise perpetrating one of 
the largest frauds in Florida's history against 
unsuspecting investors, fleecing them out of 
millions of dollars by creating, crafting and 
fabricating fellacious (sic) sexual claims 
against people like me and others, so 
unfortunately, though I would like to answer your 
questions, Mr. Edwards, my counse! has advised me 
that at least today | must assert my Sixth 
Amendment, Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth. 
Amendment rights under the U.S, Constitution. 

Q Isn't it true, sir, and I'm reading from 


' 





40 


the complaint filed by V.R. against you, isn't it 
true, sir, that a friend of yours sent you three, 
12-year old females for you to sexually abuse on 
one of your birthdays? 

MR. PIKE: Form, argumentative, 

harassing, and irrelevant to this lawsuit. 

‘THE WITNESS: Excuse me. 

A You're saying it is part of the 
lawsuit? 
Q Yes, Fl read it, 

"On one of the defendant Epstein's 
birthdays, a friend of defendant Epstein sent him 
three, 12-year old girls from France who spoke no 
English for defendant to sexually exploit and 
abuse? After doing so they were sent back to 
France the next day.” 

Isn't that trae? 

MR. PIKE: Once again, move to strike, 
irrelevant, argumentative, harassing, and 
for the record, the exhibit that's being 
read ftom is a complaint that’s unrelated to 
the instant matter and not filed or 
incorporated by the current plaintiff, L_M., 
in this matter. 

Ad would like to answer that question, I 


41 


really would; however, today my attomeys have 
told me I have to assert my Fifth Amendment, 


Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights] ~ 


of the U.S. Constitution, especially because your 
firm involved in this lawsuit has fabricated, 
widely reported, muitiple cases of sexual 
harassment cases against individuals like me and 
others, perpetrating what the U.S. Attorney 
called one of the largest frauds in Florida's 
history, fleecing people out of millions of 
dollars, so though } would like to answer that 
question, today I have to assert those rights or 
risk losing my attorneys" counsel. 

Q Isn't it true that you forced V.R. as 2 
15-year old girl to have sex with numerous 
friends of yours? 

A Are you kidding? 

Q Reading from a lawsuit. 

A_ Sorry, Mr. Edwards, Though I would like 
to answer that question as well, as I've answered 
most of your other questions here today, 1 would 
like to respond; however, my attorneys here today 
have advised me I have to assert my Fifth

US. Attomey as being a criminal enterprise, and

Basically -- sorry, if] didn't read correctly, 
um.... the operation of the enterprise through 
various criminal activities including mail fraud, 
wire fraud and money laundering, fabricating 
sexual harassment cases against people like me

Q By the way -- 

A Yes, sir? 

Q -- didn’t V.R. receive a round trip 
ticket paid for by you to Thailand, and she 
ultimately did not get back on the plane but

Mr. Edwards, you know that there are 
various standing orders, if not in this 
case, in various other cases, that 
specifically describe the protections of the 
Fifth Amendment, Federal Courts have 
ordered that certain questions that you are 
asking shall not be answered or Mr. Epstein 
would risk losing his Fifth Amendment 
right -- 

MR. EDWARDS: I understand that. He is 
asking to spell people's names, 

MR. PIKE: -- under the United States 
Constitution. A lot of these questions here 
today that you're asking have already been 
ruled on by various Courts, that the Fifth 
Amendment protects any response thereto, so 
1 would like -- I'm giving you some leeway 
here with regard to the argumentative 
questions. We've already -- and I'm not 
obviously testifying for the witness, but 
we've already handled a fot of these issues.

deposition for being argumentative, and I 
think you understand what the Court said 
there, so having said that, and I understand

professionaliy, if you continue with the

to~ 

MR, EDWARDS: Mr. Brunel -- 

MR. PIKE; I want the Court to know we 
are here today to allow you to ask your 
questions, but the harassing and 
argumentative tone is not going to be 
tolerated. 

MR. EDWARDS: We have a video. We can 
show the Court the tone. It is obviously 
not harassing. 

MR. PIKE: That's fine. 

Q Mr. Brunel is a long-term friend of 
yours, right?

today my attorneys have counseled me that { must 
invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment 
and Fifth Amendment right, or risk -- and if L 
don't, I risk fosing them as my attorneys so, 
therefore, I must assert those rights. 

Q You're laughing as if my questions are 
fudicrous right now but you're aware that there 
were trash pulls from your home where there were 
message pads, messages taken by various employees 
of yours, where these terms, "Massage," "Work" 
were used in conjunction with underage minor 
females coming over to your house, weren't you? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections, form, as 

well. Move to strike, and also assumes 

facts not in evidence. Lack predicates. 

Q You're aware of the trash pull and the 
message pads, correct? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections, 

Do you have any documents with you here 
today that you speak of? 

MR. EDWARDS: No, but at this point in 

time in the trial, they will already about 

in evidence. 

A I'm aware of a trash pull? What's a 

‘trash pull"? I'm son 


Q Are you aware of -- I'll ask it of you 
this way: When Sarah Kelien would take a phene 
message for you, what did she write it down 
with? 

MR. PIKE: Form, 

A. The question makes no sense to me, 
sorry. 

Q Ifanother employee of yours were to 
auswer the telephone, be it your housekeeper, 
housemanager, would answer the phone, take a 
message for you and write it down so that you 
could read it later, what would that message be 
written on? 

A. Most likely paper. 

Q Okay, is that paper typically in the 
form of a message pad that has 2 carbon copy 
sheet to the back? 

A No. 

Q You're unfamiliar with the documents 
that I'm talking about, that being a message pad 
that informs you as to who called, the time they 
called and the purpose for calling? 

MR. PHKE: For purposes of the question 
you're specifically talking about a message 

pad, nothing related to what you're defining 





as a trash pull, just what someone takes as 

a message at Mr. Epstein's home and -- 

A Do know what a message pad is? 

Q Ne. In your home, do you typically have 
your housekeeper, housemanager, or somebody else, 
when they take a message for you, write ona 
specific pad that informs you as to who is 
calling, the time they are calling and the 
purpose for their calling, and there is a carbon 
copy sheet evidencing that message? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, asked and 

answered, 

Q You know what I'm talking about? 

A. {know what a message pad is. 

Q Do you use them commonly in your home or 
did you back prior to your arrest? 

AF would like to answer that question, 
but today my attorneys have advised me I have to 
assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution, so therefore, I'm going to do that 
or I risk losing their representation. 

Q Is my question to you confusing? Do you 
know what I'm talking about? 

=, MR. PIKE: Form, : 


97 


A. Not specifically, no. 
Q Okay. 
The information — 

A. Is there something you have to show me, 
so I know what you're talking about? 

Q I don't have it to show you today, but 
if the information and evidence that [ have 
learned through this process is accurate and 
correct, it would seem a foregone conclusion that 
you and I would be on the same page, at least 
about this document, so -- 

A Okay, 

Q ~if we are going to get toa point you 
tell me "This document doesn't exist" or “I don't 
know what you're talking about," okay, that's 
fine, but that's something we can hash out, 

Here is my question: When a 
housekeeper/housemanager would take a message for’ 
you from any caller, is there a specific message 
pad that has a carbon copy located near your 
telephone, for them to write down the name of the 
caller, the purpose for the call and the time 
calied? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

Q [Es that something you're familiar with?

A_ I would like to respond to that 
question. Today my attorneys have counseled me I 
must assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment | 
and Fourteenth Amendment right under the U.S, } 
Constitution. 

Q You're invoking your Fifth Amendment 
right is not that you understand the question. 
You understand my question and are electing to 
invoke your Fifth Amendment rights; is that 
correct? 

A Yes. 

Q When Sarah Kellen or a housekeeper or 
housemanager, whoever happened to be employed at) 
the time, would take messages, what form would 
you normally or typically receive them in? 

A (Witness shrugs.) 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A Tdon't understand the question. 

Q When a caller would call the home, 
housemanager or housekeeper or Sarah Kellen, I 
don't know what you would call her, assistant, 
would answer the phone, and take a message for =| 
you so that you would know who called, what would | 
they typically write down the message on so that 


you would have it? : i 


MR. PIKE: Objection. Object to the 

form, lacks predicate. You have not 

established anything here today relative to 

a housekeeper or housemanager or the like. 

Um... And I'm trying to understand the 

question, But -- 

MR. EDWARDS: Really? 
MR. PIKE: ~ it lacks predicate. 
MR. EDWARDS: This will play well. 

A Piece of paper. 

Q Normally they would write it down ona 
piece of paper and give it to you? 

A. I didn't say that, 

Q Have you ever been given a message that 
is ripped out of a message pad that has a carbon { 
copy to it? } 

A Oh, I see. Okay. I intend -- | would 
like to answer that question, but today my 
attorneys have advised me J must respond by 
invoking my Sixth Amendment right, my Fifth 
Amendment right and my Fourteenth Amendment 
rights under the U.S, Constitution. Though I 
would like to answer these questions, accordingly 
JT must assert those rights or I risk losing my 
representation here today.

Q Between the years 2002 and 2005, who was 
your house manager? 

A. (No response.) 

Q If there is more than one, tell us 
that, 

A The question is unclear. I'm sorry. 

Q Okay, let me start with between 2002 and 
2005, did you empioy a housemanager? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Where? 

Q Atyour Palm Beach home. 

A. intend to respond to all relevant 
questions here today, Mr. Edwards. Hopefully we 
will get some, But my attorneys have advised me 
that today I must invoke my Sixth Amendment, 
Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights 
under the U.S. Constitution; or risk losing them 
as counsel. So today I have to assert those 
privileges. 

Q De you know L.M.? 

A_ Lintend to respond to all relevant 
questions regarding this lawsuit. However, at 
the present time no matter how much I would like 
to answer that question, ] cannot, because my 
counsel -- the attorneys have told me that I have 


101 


to invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and. 
Fourteenth Amendmient or, in fact, risk losing 

their representation, Therefore, I'm going to 

have to assert my rights under those, 

Q LM. is a female that was born in July 
of 1988, 

A {Is that a question? 

Q Not yet. When is the first time that 
you met her? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, speculation. 

MR. EDWARDS: That assumes that he did 
meet her; is that what you're saying? 

MR. PIKE: Your question assumes ~ 

MR. EDWARDS: He met her? 

MR. PIKE: - exactly what he just said 
which hasn't been established on the record 
yet pursuant to the appropriate Florida 
Rules of Civil Procedure and the Evidence 
Code. Lacks predicate. 

A That being said, I would like to answer 
that question, but today my attorneys have 
counseled me that I cannot, and they've advised 
me I must assert my Sixth Amendment right, my 
Fourteenth Amendment right, and my Fifth 
Amendment right under the U.S, Constitution.

THE WITNESS: Can you throw me one of 

the suckey candies, please 

Thank you. 

MR. EDWARDS: (Handing candy.) 

THE WITNESS: Appreciate it. 

Q Isn‘t it true you met L.M. for the first 
time in Jaly or Angust of 2002 just before her 
fourteenth birthday? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A. You know, your firm has been accused by 
the U.S. Attorney of perpetrating one of the 
targest frauds in South Florida history by 
crafting sexually charged lawsuits against people 
fike me and others in order to fleece 
unsuspecting investors here in South Florida out 
of millions of dollars, The firm of you and Mr. 
Jaffe. The U.S. Attorney described it as bogus 
schemes contrived by your firm. 

1 would like to answer every one of your 
questions here today; however, my attorneys have 
counseled me that I may not, and have advised me 
that I have to invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth 
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights under 
the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, that's what 1 

fe will do, otherwise Trisk losing their 


representation. 

Q Isn't it true L.M. asa 13 or 14-year 
old girl was taken to your house by another 
underage minor female, that being Carolyn 
Andriano? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Tissue, please. 
MR. EDWARDS: (Handing tissue.) 

A. I would like to answer that question 
like all the other questions you've asked me here 
today, but today my attorneys have counseled me 
that I have to invoke my Sixth Amendment right, 
my Fifth Amendment right and Fourteenth Amendment 
rights under the U.S. Constitution; therefore 
that’s what I will do, 

Q Do you know who Carolyn Andriano is, 
right, she had a lawsuit against you previously? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A. Again the last name? 

Q Carolyn Andriano. 

A Could you spell it for me? 

Q Well, the pseudonym that she used in her 
lawsuit against you alleging similar facts to 
those alleged in L.M. verses Jeffrey Epstein was 
C.M.A. versus Jeffrey Epstein. 





A And now the question? 
Q You know who she is, correct? 
MR. PIKE; Form. 

A_ [would like to answer that question 
here, Mr. Edwards, but unfortunately today my 
attomeys have counseled me I must invoke my 
Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution, and 
if 1 don't, I risk iosing their representation, 
therefore I must assert those rights. 

Q When I asked you about L.M. or Carolyn 
Andriano, you sat there for a while thinking hard 
about whether or not you knew them. Do you 
remember either L.M. or Carolyn Andriano? 

MR. PIKE: I move to strike counsel's 
statement because the statement as worded 
assumes facts certainly not in evidence, It 

is argumentative, speculates as to what is 

"thinking hard,” and, counsel, I don't 

understand the question on the table, 

combined with your narrative, If you could 

repeat the question? 

MR. EDWARDS: Sure. 

Q Fm asking if during this questioning 
Gs process, has it refreshed your recollection as to 

105 


who L.M. is or do you really have no idea who 
that is? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Asked and answered. 

Q Do you remember L.M.? 

A Are you going to ask one question? 
Which question would you like answered first? 

Q Do you remember L.M.? 

A_ | would like to answer that question. 1 
would like to answer that question today; however 
my attorneys today have advised me that J must 
assert my Fourteenth Amendment, Fifth Amendment 
and Sixth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution, no matter how much I would like to 
answer these questions, So unfortunately, I'm 
going to assert those righis. 

Q When you first met L.M., isn't i¢ true 
that she was just about to begin her ninth grade 
year in high school? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. Form. 

A 1 believe her testimony in front of the 
FBI, in a swom deposition says something else, 
but I don't recall exactly what. I don't have 
any recollection, 

Q OfL.M. 

MR, PIKE: Fonn.

A You asked the question when I met her, I 
think, if | met her. 

Q You have no recollection as to when you 
met her? 

A I don't have recollection if | ever met 
her. I just told you, I did read her FBY 
statement, so T know what she has said and it is 
not what you've just represented to me. 

Q Your only knowledge of any interaction 
you may have had with L.M. is derived from an FBI 
Statement that she gave; is that true? 

A [believe what you just represented she 
said was not what she had sworn to. 

Q I'm not asking what she said, I'm 
asking do you independently remember if she was 
entering into her ninth grade year of high school | 
when you met her? Independent of anything you've | 
read, 

MR. PIKE: All right, let me just move 

to strike the... Diatribe between Mr. 

Edwards and Mr. Epstein. I'm confused as to 

what question is on the table now. 

MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 

Q Independent of anything you've ever 

read — 





107 | 

A Okay. 1 

Q -- do you remember meeting L.M., just 
before she entered into her ninth grade year in 
high school? 

A_ I wouid like to answer that question, 
however my attorneys today have advised me that 
though her own statements are contradictory to 
‘what you just said, her sworn statements to the 
FBI contradict what you just said. I have to 
invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights to the U.S. 
Constitution. 

Q Just a few minutes ago when you asked 
when you met her, you said, “I don’t know if I've j 
ever met her," so is that your testimony, that i 
you don't know if you ever met L.M.? 

A My testimony is very clear. I must 
assert the rights my attorneys have asked me to 
assert today, though her testimony under oath to 
the FBI is not what you represented {t to be, to 
me, and the ladies and gentlemen of the jury who 
are watching this, hopefully. 

‘MR. PIKE: Form. | 

Q We will get into that. i 

A Okay. |

Q When you first came into the room today, 
didn't you look at me and say "I like L.M." Isn't 
that the statement that you made to me? 

MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 

A don't believe I said that, 

Q What is it that you believe you did say 
referencing L.M. when you sat down in that seat 
prior to the cameras rolling? 

MR. PIKE: Form. Counsel, I was here 
during that whole time and I don't recall 

any such statement. 

MR. EDWARDS: You weren't in the room. 

A I don't remember. I don't know, 

Sorry. 

Q So is it your testimony right now that 
you did not say to me "I like L.M."? 

A. That's 

MR. PIKE: Objection. 

A ~ that's correct. 

Q Do you like L.M.? 

MR. PIKE: Form, predicate, and 

relevance, 

A Lwould like to answer al] your 
questions here as I've... tried to do my best, 


however, my attorneys have advised me that I must 


109 
assert my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment 
and Fifth Amendment rights under the U.S, 
Constitution. 

Q When you first met L.M., isn't it true 
that you knew she was an economically 
disadvaniaged girl that needed money? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, speculation, 

assumes facts not in evidence, and it is 

argumentative as worded. 

A I would like to answer all your 
questions here today, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. 

Jaffe. However, on advice of counsel | have to 
assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution, or risk losing my right to 

effective representation. So accordingly I must 
assert those rights as guaranteed by the Sixth, 

Fifth and Fourteenth amendments. 

Q When she was a 14-year old girl, she was 
taken into your bedroom and you ordered her to 
take her clothes off; is that correct? 

_ MR. PIKE: Objection, vague, confusing. 

As to "her," I'm not quite sure who you... 

Q When L.M. was a 14-year old girl, she 
was taken up to your bedroom and you ordered her

to take her clothes off; isn't that true? 
MR. PIKE: Objection, speculation, and 
assumes facts not in evidence. Lacks 

predicate. 

A Though once again what you've just 
represented to me is a totat contradiction to the 
FBI sworn statement that I read of L.M., | must 
unfortunately respond by asserting the rights 
demanded by my attorneys today, which is my Sixth 
Amendment, Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment right against -- sorry, given by the 
U.S. Constitution, though her testimony is 
exactly ~- does not purport in any way to what 
you've just said. 

Q And when L.M. was 14 years old, you 
ordered she begin to give you a massage while she 
was naked and you were naked; isn't that true? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A_ Sorry, you have to repeat the question 
for me. 

Q When L.M. was a 14-year old girl -- 

A Right. Yes? 

Q --you laughed and said, "right" about 
what? 

A ldidn't hear | the first, part of your 





111 


question. Now I understood it. 

Q When L.M. was a 14-year old girl, wasn't 
it true that you received a massage from her 
while she was naked and you were naked? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, speculation, 
assumes facts not in evidence, lacks 
predicate. 

A Lunderstand that your firm has been 
accused by the U.S. Attorney of South Florida, 
perpetrating one of the largest frauds in 
Florida's history, by crafting malicious, 
sexually charged allegations against people like 
me. I understand L.M.'s testimony is not what 
you've just described, though she swore to the 
FBI... under oath, Though I would like to answer 
your questions here today, my attorneys have 
advised me I may not. I must assert my Sixth, 
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the 
U.S. Constitution or risk losing their 
representation. 

THE WITNESS: Restroom break.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the video 

record 1:49 p.m. 

THE WITNESS: Thank you. 
{Pause in the proceedings.) 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the video 

record 2:04 p.m. 

Q Mr. Epstein, when L.M. was a 14-year old 
girl, isn't it true that while you were naked on 
the massage table, you ordered L.M. to take off 
her clothes and provide you a massage? 

A. [believe I've answered that question, 
didn't I? 

Q don't remember where we left off, 
that's why. 

MR. PIKE: Form, argumentative, 
speculation. It is compound and assumes 

facts not in evidence and has been asked and 

answered, But we did take a break, so you 

can respond, 

(Counsel addressing Mr. Epstein.) 

A. The current U.S, Attorney has described 
your law firm as a criminal enterprise involved 
in fabricating sexually charged cases against 
people like me in order to fleece unsuspecting 
investors out of millions of dollars. He used 
113 
words like "bogus schemes,” 

Unfortunately at this time in response 
to your questions, though I would like to answer 
each and every one, I'm going to have to, on 
advice of counsel, assert my Sixth Amendment, 
Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights 
under the U.S. Constitution, though f would like: 
to answer those questions. 

Q While L.M. was a naked 14-year old girl 
providing you a massage, you ordered her to pinch 
your nipples during that massage; isn't that 
true? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections, 

argumentative, speculation, harassing, 

assumes facts not in evidence and lacks 

predicate. 

A. Lasked her to pinch her nipples? 

Q Pinch your nippies? 

A. Lbelieve her own swom testimony 
contradicts that statement. However, I would 
like to answer all your questions here today, but 
my attorneys advised me, at least today, Mr. 
Edwards, I must take my constitutional privileges 
of the Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment, keeping in mind that your

firm, of you, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. Jaffe's firm. 
has been accused by the U.S. Attorney of 
perpetrating one of the largest frauds in 
Florida's history by crafting sexually charged. 
lawsuits against people like me, to fleece from 
focal people millions of dollars. 

Q And during this massage by L.M., you 
began to masturbate in front of her; isn't that 
true? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections? 

A Unfortunately, though I would fike to 
answer each one of your questions here today, my 
attorneys have counseled me today at least, 1 
have to assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth 
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights under 
the U.S, Constitution, otherwise { risk losing 
their effective representation, and the fact that 
your firm has been accused of fabricating these 
malicious lawsuits to fleece investors out of 
millions of dollars, as described by the U.S, 
Attorney here in South Florida as a criminal 
enterprise involved in mai] fraud, money 
laundering... Unfortunately | would like to 
answer each question, but I can't today. 
true that while you were 





115 
masturbating you inserted your fingers into her 
14-year old vagina? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 

Speculation. It is harassing. It assumes 

facts not in evidence. The question 

continues to lack predicate, and I also 

believe the question has been asked and 

answered sometime ago. 

A Though I would like to answer each one 
of your questions today, Mr. Edwards, my counsel 
has told me I cannot answer any questions that 
may be relevant to this lawsuit. The fact that 
your firm has been accused of major fraud, the 
jargest fraud in South Florida history, by the 
U.S. Attorney calling your firm a criminal 
enterprise involved in money laundering -- I 
believe it is racketeering, but I could be 
wrong... Monetary transactions via fraud, mail 
fraud, conspiracy -- sorry «- I would like to 
answer your questions but today on advice of 
counsel, 1 am going to have to assert my rights. 

Q Isn't it true also that while L.M. was a 
14-year oid female, you masturbated to the point 
of ejaculating while inserting your fingers into 
L.M.'s vagina?

OAIRAewWne 


116 


MR. PIKE: Same objections incorporated? 

A Again, the question? 

Q Isn't it true that during this sexual 
massage, while you were — that you masterbated 
to the point of ejaculating while you were 
inserting your fingers into L.M.’s vagina? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
speculation. It is compound. It is vague. 

Tt assumes facts not in evidence and tacks 

predicate. 

A Though I would like to answer that 
question with specificity and detail today, no 
matter how much I would like to, my attorneys 
have advised me I cannot. They advised me I must 
assert my Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution or potentially lose effective 
representation, so therefore, } will assert those 
rights. 

Q Isn't it true that the ritual that I'm 
describing occurred with L.M., approximately 100 
times when she was between the ages of 13 and 16? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections, with the 
additional objection of vague and 

confusing. 





117 


A Since your firm has been involved ~ 
according to the U.S. Attorney in crafting these 
fraudulent lawsuits in order to fleece local 
investors, and. the fact that I believe in L.M.’s 
sworn statements, that's what you've just alleged 
at feast is totally contradicted by your client's 
own sworn statements, though I would like to 
answer these questions today, my attorneys have 
advised me ] may not and advised me I must assert 
my Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights 
under the U.S. Constitution or potentially risk 
losing effective representation. 

Q In addition to the sexual abuse directed 
against L.M. that I've just described, isn't it 
true that you also paid her money to bring you 
more than 50 other underage minor females for you 
to similarly abuse? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A_ Though J believe in her own swom 
testimony to the U.S, government that she

about your firm being accused by the U.S. 
Attorney of perpetrating one of the largest

frauds in U.S. history by crafting malicious | 


lawsuits of a sexual nature in order to fleece | 
investors out of millions of dollars, local 
investors; and though I would like to answer your | 
questions in detail today, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. | 
Jaffe, my counsel says | may not and have asked 
me to assert those rights, which I must 
unfortunately, 

Q You keep bringing up this fraud of the 
former law firm known as Rothstein, Rosenfeld, 
Adler in response to my questions, so I would 
like you to tell the jury at this time which 
allegation are you now saying is fraudulent or 
untrue, that's been made by L.M.? 

MR. PIKE: Form, confusing, compound, | 
and irrelevant, 

MR. EDWARDS: Only made irrelevant by 
his answers. 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

Q Do you understand the question? 

A No. } 

Q You made reference to -- in response to 
my questions about what you did sexually to 
LM. ~~ 
A_ Yes, sir? 





Q --you have responded with these fraud 
allegations against the firm of Rothstein, 
Rosenfeld, Adler, I want you fo tell the jury 
which allegations that L.M. is making against you 
are you disputing at this time or calling a fraud 
or calfing untrue? 

MR. PIKE: Confusing, compound and -- if 
the court reporter would read back Mr. 

Epstein's response, I think you will see the 

way you just phrased the question. 

mischaracterizes his testimony. Because -- 

well, !'H keep it there unless you want me 

to go further. You want me to go further? 

MR. EDWARDS: No, I want him to go 
further. 
MR. PIKE: Mischaracterizes the 

witness's testimony. { 

A_1.M.'s own statements contradict every 
one of your allegations that you've made to me 
today, as a hypothetical. In her own words. And 
you -- and the potential reasons this concerns me 
is the fact that the law firm that represented 
L.M. and two others have been accused by the U.S. 
Attorney of fraudulently producing cases against 


me and others, to fleece investors in what he's

described as one of the largest frauds in South 
Florida's history. So, it concerns me. {tis a 
factor in the way !'m thinking about answering. 
Sorry. 

Q Each time that you digitally penetrated 
L.M. or otherwise fondled her sexually, you paid 
her $260; is that correct? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
speculative, harassing. It assumes facts 
not in evidence, and with regard to this 
line of questioning, the Court has. already 
ruled that the demeanor in which you're 
presenting this question is improper, and 
harassing, so if you would ~~ 

MR. EDWARDS: I'm very comfortable with 
the demeanor right now, Mr. Pike. These are 
just the facts of the lawsuit. The facts 
are outrageous and | understand that, but 
they have to be asked, 

MR. PIKE: Maybe the demeanor and tone 
of your question is laced in a manner that 
itis proper for the video, but the content 
of the question is the same exact harassing 
question that was deemed by the Judge to be 
argumentative. Tm not saying that he's not 


121 


going to answer your question. 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 
MR. PIKE: Or that you don't know what 

his answer will be, but what I'm saying is: 

could you rephrase the question? 

Q Answer that question. I'll work on 
rephrasing it for you at some point. 

A Sorry, J forgot what the question is by 
now. 

Q Isn't it true that each time that you 
interacted with L.M. sexually, meaning digitally 
penetrated her or fondled her in some other way, 
that you paid her $200 each time? 

MR, PIKE: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Sorry? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Go ahead. 

A. I would like to answer cach one of your 
questions here today. However, my attorneys have 
counseled me that today { have to assert my Fifth 
Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution and 
I'm cognizant of the fact that your firm has 
crafted these malicious Jawsuits, it has been 
reported that the lawsuits are of a sexual 
nature, in order to fleece investors, so though F

would like to answer those questions, Mr. 
Edwards, and Mr. Jaffe, today I must keep my 
counsel's advice. 

Q Isn't it true that for each underage 
minor that L.M. brought to you for the purposes 
of you engaging in sexual activity, you paid her 
$2602 

MR. PIKE: Objection, speculation. 

Compound question, and it assumes facts not 

in evidence, Therefore lacks predicate. 

A. Though I would like to answer that 
question, as most of your other questions here 
today, Mr. Edwards, I intend to respond, 
hopefilly at some point to all of your questions, 
but today my attorneys have advised me f must 
invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment right under the U.S. 
Constitution, 

Q Over the course of relatively a roughly 
three years, isn't it true that you touched or 
fondled L.M. in a sexual manner on more than 50 
occasions? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative. 

Calls for speculation. It is overbroad, 

confusing : and vague, and itassumes facts

not in evidence. 

A Could you repeat the question for me? 
Tim sorry, Mr. Edwards. 

Q Yes. The three-year period between 2002 
and 2005 when you were engaging in sexual conduct 
with L.M., isn't it true that that conduct took 
place on more than 50 occasions? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A. J believe if you read your own client's 
FBI statements, what her statement -- it changed 
dramatically after she decided to file a 
different lawsuit, at the request of you and your 
firm, with one of your firms ~ there have been 
many firms it seems, was accused of major fraud. 
‘Since the testimony has changed dramatically, T 
would like to answer those questions, but today 
my attorneys have advised me I must assert my 
Sixth Amendment right, my Fifth Amendment right 
and my Fourteenth Amendinent right. 

Q ** Your answers are not going to 
incriminate you if the answer is "no," it is only 
if the answer is "yes" that it will incriminate 
‘you, so aren't you telling the jury every single 
thing I've asked you is not part of a fraud, just 
happens to be true, isn't it?

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
irrelevant and move to strike. I'm simply 
going to instruct the witness not to answer 
that question because... I don't understand 
it. I don't know what to say about that 
question. 

A (Gesturing.) 

Q Af of the things that I’ve told you or 
that I've asked you about, you touching her while 
she was underage, you paying her for sexual 
conduct, those are all things that really 
happened, there is nothing about that, that 
anybody has fabricated or made up, is there? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
speculative, it assumes facts not in 
evidence, it certainly mischaracterizes the 
witness's testimony all day, since I have 
been here, and I have been here the whole 
time. It assumes facts not in evidence. It 
is also overbroad and substantially compound 
because you're attempting to incorporate all 
of your questions today into one question. 

MR. EDWARDS: | think you know, Mr. 
Pike, your objection should be limited to 

_the form. [f you object to the form, it is . 
125 


fine. 

MR. PIKE: I'm sorry, that's -- 

MR. EDWARDS: You —- 

MR. PIKE: You've asked me several times 
today fo teil you why. I thought | was 
helping. I'm sorry. I certainly will keep 
objecting to -- 

MR. EDWARDS: Appreciate it. 

MR. PIKE; -- the form, 

MR. EDWARDS: Thank you. 

Q And your answer is? 

A Repeat the question, 

Q Every single allegation that L.M. has 
made and I have now questioned you about in terms 
of your sexual involvement with L.M., they are 
all true; isn't that correct? There is nothing 
fabricated about any of these allegations, 
correct? 

MR. PIKE; Objection, argumentative, 
speculative, compound, It is vague, 
overbroad ~ 

MR. EDWARDS: You're objecting to form? 

MR. PIKE: Yes, assumes facts not in 
evidence and facks predicate. That is 
form.

U.S. Legal Support 
(561) 835-0220 











A And I would like to answer that question 
specifically today, however, on advice of counsel 
they've suggested | take the Sixth amendment -- 
assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution, keeping well aware of your firm's 
responsibifity in the largest fraud in Florida’s 
history by crafting sexually charged lawsuits 
against people like me and others. 

1 believe in addition, since her 
allegations, as you've phrased them, have changed 
dramatically since her sworn statement, until in 
fact, after she joined this firm charged with 
this major fraud and most of her statements have 
changed, | believe, so... 

Q You remember when L.M. becante pregnant 
when she was 16 years old, don't you? 

MR. PIKE: Form, relevance, move to 

strike? 

A J would like to answer each one of your 
questions here today, Mr. Edwards; each and every 
one of your questions. However, today my counsel 
has told me I must assert my Sixth Amendment, 
Fourteenth Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights 
under the U.S. Constitution. 


127 

Q Isn't it true that when E.M. was 14 
years old,.t5 years old and 46 years old, you 
touched her genitals? 

A Separate from the fact that in her own 
testimony, her own sworn testimony under oath 
before she decided to file a lawsuit for money, 
there was never any discussion about anything 
Jike that. 1 would like to answer that question, 
but my attorneys have advised me, at feast today, 
that | must assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth 
Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights under 
the U.S. Constitution. 

Q Isn't it true when she became pregnant 
at age 16, you no fonger interacted with her 
sexually but still demanded that she bring you 
other underage minor females for you to sexually 
exploit? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, speculation. 

Compound, Harassing, and assumes facts not 

in evidence. 

A_ I betieve her testimony changed 
dramatically from her sworn statements to the 
FBI- 

Q That's not a responsive -~ 

MR. PIKE: Excuse me -~

MR. EDWARDS: It is not a responsive 
answer so I won't allow -- 
MR. PIKE: That -- 
MR. EDWARDS: We'll move to strike it, 
Let's have an answer to the question. 
MR. PIKE: The witness is trying. If 
there is a legal basis for your moving to 
strike, it would be taken up with the Court 
and you can move to strike. 
You can continue. 
MR. EDWARDS: Strike it, it is 
nonresponsive? 
A Your allegations that you keep throwing 
at me, relate to the fact that L.M. testimony, 
after giving a sworn statement to the FBI, 
changed dramatically after she decided to file a 
lawsuit for money, joining your firm that's been 
accused by the U.S. Attorney of one of the 
largest frauds in Florida's history. 1 would 
like to answer those questions; however, on 
advice of counsel today I must assert my Fifth 
Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment rights under the U.S, Constitution. 
Q When L.M. was a pregnant 16 year-old, 
she brought you at feast ten underage minor__ 
129 


females during her pregnancy; isn’t that true? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
speculation. It is vague and assumes facts 
not in evidence and lacks predicate, 

A l--T-~ Lunfortunately would like to 
answer that question as well as every other 
question you've asked me here today, but my 
attorneys have advised my I must assert my Fifth 
Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. 

Q After L.M. had her son at 16 years old, 
and you were being criminally investigated for 
some of the conduct that we've discussed here 
today; isn't it true that you personally hired 
and retained and paid for an attorney to 
represent L,M.? 

MR, PIKE; Objection, speculation -- 

MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form, Mr. 
Pike, 

MR. PIKE: I will not. [am allowed to 
assert the basis for my objections, I am not 
limited to just saying "form." I'm able to 
assert the basis as to why, so I don't waive 
that basis,

MR. PIKE: It's not obstructionist, it 
is objecting to form. What is | 

obstructionist is what we are doing now. I 

will be finished within four seconds, SoI 

am going to object to form, it's 

argumentative, speculative and it assumes 

facts not in evidence and it lacks 

predicate. That’s it. 

A I'm sorry. (Witness shrugs.) Again? 

Q The response to the question. 

A I don't know the question. 

Q You don't remember the question? Did 
you hire L.M. an attorney at some point in time? | 
Do you remember that? 

MR. PIKE; Same objection. 

A_ Not to the best of my recollection. 

Q Do you know James Eisenberg? 

A ... DoT know James Eisenberg? I don't 
believe I've ever met James Eisenberg. 

Q Isit your testimony today then that you 
never paid for an attorney to represent L.M.? 
A (Witness shakes head.)... On advice of 
my counsel, I would Jike to answer that question, 
but on advice of. counsel Im going to have to 





assert my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment | 
and Fifth Amendment rights against -- excuse me, | 
Sixth Amendment rights of the U.S. Constitution. 

Q And that attorney that was paid for by 
you, informed L.M. that if she were to fell the 
FBI exactly what happened at your house, that her 
son could be taken from her. You're aware of 
that, correct? ! 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A. J recognize, | believe she made one of 
the statements at her deposition after she 
decided to sue me for a bunch of money and your | 
firm has represented a number of... cases of a 
sexually charged nature that turned out to be 
fraudulent in order to fleece local investors. 

The U.S. Attorney described your firm and these 
cases as a bogus scheme, and I'm aware of that, 
and would like to answer your question in more 
detail today, Mr. Edwards; however my attorneys 
advised me that at least today, I must assert my 
rights under the Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth 
Amendment and Fifth Amendment. 

MR. PIKE: It is the food.

(Pause in the proceedings.) 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Back on the video 
record 2:50 pn. 

Q Isn't it true, Mr. Epstein, that you 
gave L.M. money to coerce her into interacting 
with you sexually? 

A Mr. Edwards, I would like to answer cach 
and every one of your questions here today, but 
unfortunately, Jike I've done with mostly ail of 
your other questions, I'm going to have to assert 
my rights, Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment 
and Fifth Amendment on advice of counsel, 
Although I would like to answer, if] don't 
follow my counsel's advice, I risk losing 
representation. 

Q While committing these sexual acts 
against L.M. when she was just a minor, you knew 
it would psychologically damage her; isn't that 
true? 

MR. PIKE: Form, lacks predicate, 
speculation, 

A_lintend to respond at some point to — 
133 
I would like to respond to each and every one of 
your questions, but today on advice of my counsel 
they've required me to assert my Fifth Amendment, 
Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights| 
under the U.S, Constitution, though { would like 

to answer cach of these questions. 

Q In fact, you deliberately and 
intentionally caused severe emotionally distress 
to underage minor females, including L.M.; isn't 
that true? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
speculation, it is compound. And it assumes 
facts not in evidence. 

MR. EDWARDS: Okay, 

A I would like to answer that question, as 
I would like to answer ali of your other 
questions today regarding L.M, However, my 
attorneys today have advised me that J must 
assert my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation and my Fifth Amendment sight and 
my Fourteenth Amendment right. Though I would 
like to answer that with specificity, ] must 
follow my attorney's advice. 

Q Will you admit for the jury that you 
were investigated federally for your illegal

activities with underage minors? 
MR. PIKE: Same objections. 
A I would like to answer that question, as | 
weil as all the other questions you've asked me 
here today, especially since your firm has been 
accused by the federal, 1 guess, the federal 
government,... being considered a criminal -- you 
firm has been considered and investigated as 
being a criminal enterprise using sexually 
fabricated, sexual cases... fabricated cases, to 
fleece investors out of millions of dollars, but 
{ would like to answer your questions; however my 
attorneys have demanded that I assert my rights 
under the Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and | 
Fourteenth Amendment, 
Q In fact, as a result of that 
investigation, you, as well as the United States 
Attorney's Office entered into what has now been 
known and referred to as the nonprosecution 
agreement; isn't that correct? 
MR. PIKE: Same objection. The document | 
speaks for itself? 
A. You have to repeat the question. 
Q Asa result of the criminal 
vestigation into your activities with minor | 


135 


females, you reached a resolution with the United 
States Attorney's Office, in what has now been 
Gescribed as the nonprosecution agreement; is j 
that correct? 
MR. PIKE: I'm going to object. Vague, 
confusing, misrepresents the agreement and 

the document is the best evidence, Will you 

mark it? 

MR. EDWARDS: [ can mark it, We will 

copy it at the end and mark it as Exhibit 2. 

(Document, Nonprosecution Agreement, was 
deemed marked as Exhibit number 2 for 
identification, as of this date.) 

A Yes. 

Q in that agreement, there are listed 
co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein, those being 
Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Leslie Graff 
(phonetic) and Nadia Marcinkova. Can you explain | 
to the jury what those individuals did for you 
related to the crimes that were investigated by 
the federal government? 

A Co-conspirators? 

Q Yes, it says “criminal charges against 
any co-conspirators of Epstein inelnding but not | 
limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Leslie |

the jury what each of those four individuals did 
for you or conspired with you to do? 
MR. PIKE: Object to the form of the 
question? 

A_ I would like to answer that question, 
however, today my attorneys advise me that [ must 
assert my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution. 

Q Isn't it fair to say that you, as well 
as the co-conspirators, operated as an organized 
criminal enterprise designed to sexually exploit 
underage minors? 

MR. PIKE: Object to argumentative, 
speculation. It is vague and it assumes 

facts not in evidence. 

A Are you suggesting it was a criminal 
enterprise? Is that the words? 

Q Yes. 

A_ Though I would like to answer that 
question today, I think the only criminal 
enterprise that I have been reading about today 
was your firm, that's been accused of being a 
<ciminal caterpeize involved ial defrauding.

people, using mail fraud, wire fraud, money 
laundering, the operation of the enterprise ~ 
this is by the U.S, Attomney (indicating), but 
though I would tike to answer your questions with 
specificity today, on advice of counsel, though I 
would like to answer it, they demanded I assert 

my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment and 
Fifth Amendment right or I risk losing their 
representation, 

Q Did you care about any of the underage 
minor femaies at the time when you were engaging] 
in sexual conduct with them? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative. 
Harassing, already been ruled upon by the 
Court relative to this exact question, 

MR. EDWARDS: I feel comfortable with 
the question, [t goes to punitive damages. 
The issue related to the Court was a 
repetitive question on that topic or around 
that general subject matter. I'm just 
asking for Mr. Epsiein to tell the jury how 
he felt about these girls, whether he cared 
about them, when he was engaging in illegal 
sexual conduct with them, 

MR. PIKE: Counsel, i'm going to

i 
instruct him not to answer the question. ! 
You can certify it to the Court, if you 
like. You know what the answer is going to 
be; however you're attempting to lace this 
video. You know the Court has already 
ordered that these types of questions are 
not permitted because they are argumentative 
and harassing. In fact, other questions 
bordered but this question is on exact point 
with the Court's order. If you want to 
withdraw the question, that’s fine. 

MR. EDWARDS: I don't want to withdraw 
the question. 

MR. PIKE: Then I instruct him not to 
answer. 

MR. EDWARDS: Mark that somehow, that | 
page, so we can find it in the record, 

relative to the hearing that will be had on 

that question and others similar. 

Q At the time when you were engaging in 
sexual conduet with underage females, you knew 
that exposing them to this, was not beneficial or 
good for these girls; isn't that true? 

MR, PIKE: Objection, argumentative, 
speciation, ssciimed facts nok iy evident.

Lacks predicate. 

A. Though I would Hike to answer that 
question, like most of your other questions here 
today, on advice of counsel 1 must assert my i 
Fourteenth Amendment, Fifth Amendmerit and Sixth | 
Amendment rights. Though I would like to answer, 
if I do so, I risk losing my effective 
representation of counsel. 

Q Isn't it true, Mr. Epstein, that the 
only thing that you cared about was accessing as 
many underage females as possible, for the 
purposes of sex? 

MR. PIKE: Argumentative, speculation, | 

harassing. i 

A’ What's the question? i 

MR. PIKE: And assumes facts not in 
evidence. 

Q Isn't it true that the only thing that 
you cared about when you were interacting with i 
these underage females in a sexual manner, was 
ejaculating or your own personal gratification? 

MR, PIKE: Form, same exact objections.

question, and to the ladies and gentlemen of the

U.S. Constitution, or else J risk losing their 
representation. 

MR. PIKE: And Mr. Edwards, just so we 
don't have to come back on the question that 
J instructed him not to answer, if you would 
go ahead and repeat that question, I will be 
more than happy to let him respond. 

MR. EDWARDS: I don't remember the 
question we will take it up with the Court 
and we'll get a ruling on it. 

MR. PIKE; It was whether or not he 
cared about these -- I believe you quoted it 
as underage minors, but I would like the 
court reporter to read back the question 
just to conserve judicial resources and not 
go back. So if she can reread the question 
that would be good. 

MR, EDWARDS: Ifyou can find the 
question, 

THE COURT REPORTER: Certainly. 

MR. EDWARDS: I think i know it.

MR. PIKE: Same objections, as before.

question as well as most of your other questions, 
if not all of your other questions here today, on 
advice of counsel | will have to assert my 
Fourteenth Amendment sight, my Sixth Amendment 
right and my Fifth Amendment right, because no 
matter how much J actually want to answer that 
question, if 1 do so | risk losing my counsel's

Q At the time you were engaging in sexual 
activity with these underage minors, including 
L.M., you knew that this conduct was illegal, 
didn't you? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections, Form. 

A [would like to answer that question, as.

however, today my counsel has instructed me to

trouble; isn't that true? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A_T would fike to answer that question, as ; 
well as the other questions; however, my counsel 
has advised me that today I must assert my 
Fourteenth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fifth 
Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. 

Q The underage minor females that have 
come forward with information about your sexual 
interactions with them have been investigated, 
harassed, humiliated in an effort for you to 
intimidate them to go away. Is that true? 

MR. PIKE: Objection. Argumentative, 
speculative, compound. It is overbroad, and 
assumes facts not in evidence. 

A Can you repeat the question? 

Q Sure. Any underage minor female that 
you engaged in sexual activity with, that has now | 
pursued a lawsuit against you, isn't it true that | 
you've spent a lot of money and a lot of 
resources investigating them in an effort to 


143 





intimidate them and hopefully make them go away? | 
MR. PIKE: Same objections. j 

A I believe your client's testimony 

changed dramatically when she joined up with you 
and your law firm, accused of fraud, when she 
decided to change her testimony, at least from 
what the statements said, both to the police and 
to the FBI, and decided to seek money. However, 
anything above that or beyond that, I'm going to 
have to, in fact, assert my Fifth Amendment, 
Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights 
as directed by my competent counsel. } 
Unfortunately, they have told me if E don't, 1 
tisk losing their representation, 

Q Allright, IM give you a chance here 
since you keep bringing up her statement to the i 
FBI as opposed to her sworn testimony for 13 
hours under oath in this case. Are you saying 
that the sworn testimony to the FBI was, in fact, 
the truth? 

A. What I'm saying is, it seems her 
testimony has changed dramatically after she 
joined your firm, that's all. 

Q Okay. Irrespective of her testimony, 
you've read her testimony and you read her

testimony ~ to the FBL. You watched her 
deposition when it was being taken. Which -- 

A. You'te meking assumptions; Pm sorry. 

MR. PIKE: Let him finish the question. 
THE WITNESS: Sorry. 

A My fant, 

MR. PIKE: Then Fil object and you'll 
respond, 

Q Which are you saying is the truthful 
testimony, her statement to the FBI or the 
videotaped deposition that you watched? 

MR. PIKE: Object to the form. 

A What I've said, and I think I'll repeat 
myself is until she joined your firm and started 
to seek money, her testimony was different. 
That's my understanding, 

Q Are you denying any sexual involvement 
with L.M. at this time? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

AT would like to answer that question. | 
would like to answer it as with most of your 
questions here today, however, my attorneys have 
advised me that } must take that -- assert my 
rights under the Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth 


Amendment and Fifth Amendment, no matter how much 


145 


T would like to answer that question, or 
potentially risk losing my counsel. 

Q Isn't your game plan with al of these 
civil lawsuits that have been filed against you, 
to spend as much money as you can te investigate, 
and harass these young women into hopefaily 
dropping the lawsuits against you? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, Relevance. Move 

to strike. It is argumentative and 

harassing. 

A_ I would like to answer that question. 1 
think you know the answer to that question. 

Q Yes. 

A. (Witness nods.) However, today my 
attorneys have advised me | must assert my Sixth 
Amendment rights, my Fourteenth Amendment rights 
and my Fifth Amendment rights, 

Q You don't have any remorse for the 
sexua} abuse that you committed against L.M., do 
you? 

MR. PIKE: Objection. It is 

argumentative, It is harassing. It is, I 

believe, confined under the Judge's order 

and it assumes facts not in evidence? 

A. That being said, I would like to answer

that question today, but my attorneys have 
advised me that I must assert my Fourteenth 
Amendment rights, my Fifth Amendment rights and 
my Sixth Amendment rights. 
Q In fact, yon recently sued L.M., didn't 
you? z 
A Yes, and you and your firm that's been 
accused of the largest fraud in Florida's 
history, described by the U.S. Attorney as a 
criminal enterprise involved in money laundering, 
conspiracy to commit one crime -- excuse me, mail 
fraud, commit conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 
Yes, I sued you, your firm and L.M. 
Q ** Tell the jury — 
A Yes, i 
Q ~ the basis for the evidence that you i 
have to support the allegations in the complaint 
against L.M. 
MR. PIKE: I'm going to instruct the 
witness not to answer that question in this 
medium, as it is wholly irrelevant 
currently, as were it, to this particular 
lawsuit, 
MR. EDWARDS: Just so you can rethink 
that position, the lack of remorse goes to 


147 


punitive damages, that is an aspect of the 
case that L.M. has against Mr. Epstein. 

MR, PIKE: This lawsuit, the current one 
Mr. Epstein is noticed for, and the lawsuit 
in which Mr. Epstein has filed against the 
former Rothstein, Rosenfeld, Adier, L.M. and 
Mr. Brad Edwards, is not proper for this 
medium ~ 

MR. EDWARDS: J understand your 
position. 

MR. PIKE: 











~ in that regard, I'm going | 
to instruct him not to answer any questions | 
relative to that lawsuit because of that i 
objection, as well as, it is my | 
understanding that Mr. Scarola has set Mr. | 
Epstein's deposition, I believe, either 
early next week or mid-March, on the case of 
Epstein versus RRA, Rothstein, Rosenfeld and 
Adler, Mr. Edwards, as well as L.M. 
‘Therefore when that time approaches, that 
would be the appropriate time for those type 
of questions, related to that lawsuit. 

MR. EDWARDS: | understand your position; 
completely, Mr. Pike. 

MR. PIKE: Thank you.

Q ** But as it relates to, obviously L.M. 
sued you making the allegations that you sexually 
molested her from when she was 13 years old to 
when she was 16 years old and now you've sued her 
in something that is seemingly retated to that 
case, and ¥ just want to understand what your 
factual basis is, or what evidence you're using 
to support your lawsuit against L.M., so that the 
jury can he valuate whether that is evidence of 
lack of remorse that would go to punitive damages 
claims that L.M. has against you. 

MR, PIKE: I would instruct him not to 
answer that question, for the same reasons 

stated. 

MR. EDWARDS: Let's mark that. 

Q Is it your feeling that because you are 
wealthy and these children are poor, that you are 
entitied to sexually abuse them? 

MR. PIKE: Argumentative. 

Q In speaking abont these children, and 
including L.M. 

MR. PIKE: Argumentative, speculation, 
compound, it’s vague, and it assumes facts 

not in evidence. 

A Inkeeping with your firm's propensity 

149 


for filing fellacious (sic), manufactured, 

sexually charged cases, based on nothing but thin 
air, accused by the U.S, Attorney of the largest 
fraud in South Florida's history, by 

manufacturing sexual cases, I would like to 

answer each and every one of your questions, 
including why I sued you, but today I'm not going 

to be able to. | have to simply listen to my 

counsel and assert my Sixth Amendment, Fourteenth 
Amendment and Fifth Amendment right. 

Q This answer that you keep reciting, 
about the Rothstein, Rosenfeld, Adler firm -- 

A You do know who they are, right? 

Q - you are aware, obviously, that all of 
the lawsuits that were filed against you, 
including L.M.'s, were filed at least a year 
before, or approximately a year before Rothstein, 
Rosenfeld, Adler had any of these cases; you're 
aware of that, right? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A Ido not know when Rothstein Adler got 
involved in these cases, I do know that the 
moment that they did surface, and, in fact, I 
understand you shared information with all the 
other attorneys that you so -- that the jury 


38 (Pages 146 to 149} 


U.S. Legal Support 
(561) 835-0220 











150) 


should understand that the information 
gathered -- according to the U.S. Attomey, by 
illegal means, has been shared with all the other 
attorneys that you keep representing have filed 
cases against me; yes, I'm aware of that. 

Q don't understand that answer. Steven, 
do you -- 

MR. PIKE: Do you have a question? 

MR. EDWARDS: I want to understand what 
his answer was. As in all depositions, if 
you don't understand the answer, clarify the 
answer. 

MR. PIKE: No, you have to ask a 
question. i 

MR, EDWARDS: I did. And he's 
responding to it. 

MR. PIKE: The witness has answered the 
question. Do you have another question to 
clarify his answer? 

MR. EDWARDS: Yes. 

Q Please clarify your answer. 

MR. PIKE: | will instruct him not to { 
answer. It's vague and confusing, it's 
narrative. 

_MR. EDWARDS: Me sayin 








answer" is narrative? 

MR. PIKE: What do you mean by "clarify 
your answer? 

MR. EDWARDS: | didn't hear what he | 
said. Say it again so I can hear it, 

MR. PIKE: Would you please read back 
what Mr. Epstein just testified to, madam 
court reporter. 

(The record was read.) 

MR. EDWARDS: Okay. } 

MR. PIKE: It was an answer, a | 
question -- | 

MR. EDWARDS: I understand -~- 1 mean I 
don’t understand the answer, but now I know 
the answer. 

MR. PIKE: Okay. | 
Q At this point in time, please tell the | 

jury what is your defense of the claims being 
asserted against you in this lawsuit by L.M.? 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to object. Calls 
for a legal conclusion. 

A What are the claims? So since you're 
representing L.M., can you tell me what the 
claims are? 

Q Yes, we've gone through it. She went to 





SAR ewWHE 


152 


your house when she was 13, 14, 15, 16 years 
ald -- 

A Is that aclaim? 

Q —she was in your bedroom. You 
instructed her to get naked. You inserted your 
fingers into her vagina. You used a vibrator on 
her. You coerced her into recruiting other 
underage minor females, roughly 58 or so more. 

These are all claims that have amounted 
to various counts, coercion, prostitution, 
intentional infliction of emotional distress, 
battery, committing various crimes against her. 
What are your defenses to that? Nermal defenses 
are "I didn't do it," "E did it, but it didn't 
hart her,” we are trying to understand so we know 
hew 0 provide this case to the jury, what are 
your defenses to these allegations? 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to object to this 

line of questioning. It is compound; as 

worded it could call for disclosure of 

attorney/client information as well as work 

product. I believe in this particular case 

there is a document filed, answer in 

affirmative defenses, and the affirmative 

defenses are set forth there and the 


document there speaks for itself. 

MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 

Q Respond, 

A. The document speaks for itself. 

Q ** So you agree with the affirmative 
defenses that were filed in your case? If you 
were to testify, we could expect that to be your 
testimony? 

MR. PIKE: That's not what the witness 
testified. The witness testified that the 
document speaks for itself, and again, }'m 
going to object to attorney/client, work 
product and instruct the witness not to 
answer. 

Q I'm not asking what your legal defense 
is. I'm asking: What is your response to the 
claims? 

MR. PIKE: Same objection. 

Q What is your personal response? 

A I would like to respond to that 
question. I would like to respond today to that 
question; however, today my attorneys have told 
me that I cannot respond. They've asked me to 
assert my Fourteenth Amendment, Sixth Amendment 
and Fifth Amendment rights of the U.S. 





39 (Pages 150 to 153) 


U.S. Legal Support 
(561) 835-0220 


Constitution, though I would really like to 
respond. They are telling me if] did so, I will 
Jose risking their representation. 

Q Tknow you've invoked your Fifth 
Amendment rights related to many of these 
questions, but isn't it true you recently 
contacted George Rush at The New York Daily News 
and spoke to him about L.M.'s case as well as 
several of the other girls, who have claims 
against you? 

A Who? 

Q George Rush, New York Daily News. 

A Can you repeat the question? 

Q Didn't you recently, within the last 
year, contact George Rush of The New York Daily 
News and discuss these cases that have been filed 
against you and the allegations made by these 
varions females? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A_ [would like to answer that question, 
but unfortunately today my attorneys have advised 
me cannot. They've advised me I must assert my 
Sixteenth -- excuse me, my Fourteenth Amendment, 
Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendment right, so 

therefore, I will do so, 


155 


Q Why is it that you will talk to George 
Rush about this but you will not talk to the jury 
about this? 

MR. PIKE: Form. Argumentative, 
speculation. Misstates the witness's 

testimony, It assumes facts -- the question. 

assumes facts not in evidence and now lacks 

predicate. 

A. So who is George Rush again?

Q George Rush, reporter with The New York! 10

didn't talk to him, tell me that. That's fine. 
MR, PIKE: Same objections, 

A_ I would like to teil you answers to each 
one of your questions, however today my attorneys 
have demanded that I respond by asserting my 
Fourteenth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, Fifth 
Amendment privilege, though I would like to 
respond, but they said if I do so, I risk losing, 
their representation. 

Q Didn't you tell George Rush these 
underage minors were not victims at ali and that 
regardless of their age, you did not personally 
consider them victims? 

MR. PIKE: Same objection.

of my counsel, J must -- as I have done with 
mostly each one of your questions, ] have to 
assert my Fiflh Amendment, Sixth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. 
Constitution. 

Q You were $i when L.M. was 14, and you 
were interacting with her sexually, is Ht your 
testimony that despite the disparity in age you 
do not consider L.M. to be a victim? 

MR, PIKE: Argumentative, speculation, 
assumes facts not in evidence. Compound, 
lacks predicate, 

A Not only does it contradict your own. 
ctient's statements to the FBI under sworn 
testimony, I would like to answer that question. 
Hopefully one day J can answer that question, but 
today my attorneys have said I cannot. They 
advised me I must assert my Sixth Amendment, 
Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights. 

Q Inthe last ten years, what is the 
youngest underage minor femate that you have 
interacted with sexually? 

MR, PIKE: Argumentative, speculation,

but my attorneys have advised me { must assert my 
Fourteenth Amendment rights, my Sixth Amendment 
rights and Fiflh Amendment rights.

Q Former housekeeper/employee of yours,

Michael Friedman did for you? 

A Yes. 

Q Are you aware that our investigator 
spoke with Michael Friedman, former housekeeper 
for you, or housemanager for you, out in 
California? 

A No, 

Q Any reason why when asked about the 
activity that occurred ia your house, he would 
tear up and say, "I was hoping to forget 
everything I saw"? 

MR. PIKE: Objection, argumentative. 

Speculative. Assumes facts not in

A Again, the question?

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the video

contacted you within the last six months? 

A ... No.

some of these questions, have you remembered who! 
that person is, or still1no real memory ofhimat = { 
all? 

A. No seal memory. 

Q To the best of your knowledge, he never 
worked for you? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 
A Not that I can recall, but there are 


159 


lots of people who work for me, 30... 

Q Can you tell the jury who the various 
people are that work for you now? 

A [believe I answered that question 
already. 

Q In that you invoked your Fifth 
Amendment, correct? 

A. That's correct, Sixth Amendment and 
Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Eigthteen and twenty-first? 

A. (Witness shrugs.) 

MR. PIKE: Move to strike. 

Q ** Have you, during this litigation, and 
by “this litigation,” I don't only mean L.M.'s 
case, but the various other lawsuits that have 
been filed against you by other females alleging 
sexual misconduct by you against them. Who have 
you retained attorneys for, what witnesses have 
you retained attorneys for? 

MR. PIKE: Object to the form.

personally, that is paying for the attorneys‘ 
fees related to your representation?

Q Who is writing the check to your 
attorneys for your representation in this 
lawsuit? 

A (No response.) 

Q Who is paying the bill? 

A Ibelieve Lam. 

Q And is it you, personally, or is this

sure whether it is coming from one of the other 
corporations that we've discovered during

Is that correct? 

MR. PIKE: Asked and answered.

A_ 1 believe -- ] would like to answer but 
Thave to invoke my Sixth, Fourteenth and Fifth 
Amendment rights. 

Q Asit relates to any of the other 
witnesses who have had attorneys retained for 
them, is it also your response to invoke your 
Fifth Amendment rights, rather than to provide me 
with an answer, as to who is paying the bill for 
those attorneys? 

A I would like to answer those questions, 
but today my attorneys have asked me not to 
respond to any questions that may be relevant to 
this lawsuit, so I must follow their advice and 
invoke the Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and

Q You would agree, wouldn't you, that you 
targeted these underage girls including L.M. 
because of their young age? 

MR. PIKE: Argumentative, speculative, 
harassing. Assumes facts not in evidence. 

A Il would like to answer that question, as

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 12 

A I would like to answer that question, as 13 
most of your other questions here today, Mr. ; 14 
Edwards. On advice of counsel today, I'm going ; 15

Q Would you agree that your interaction | 20

her? 22 
MR. PIKE: Same objections. 23

today; however, my counsel has advised me that 1 
must assert my Fourteenth Amendment rights, my 
Sixth Amendment rights and my Fifth Amendment 
rights, and though I would like to answer those 
questions, if I do so I risk losing their 
representation. 
THE WITNESS: Can we take a ten-minute 
break for some air? 
MR. EDWARDS: We have 15 minutes and 
we're done. 
THE WITNESS: Continue then? 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 

Q Would you agree that you intentionally 
indoctrinated L.M. into this very deviant sexual 
Hfestyle? 

MR. PIKE: Okay, !'m going to object. 

It is argumentative. It is confusing. It 

is speculative, vague, lacks predicate and 

assumes facts not in evidence. 

A. And on top of that, I would like to 
answer that question, but my counsel has advised 
me I must assert my Fourteenth Amendment, Sixth 
Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights under the 
US. Constitution. Although I would like to 
answer all your questions today, Icannot do so

risking losing their representation. 

Q Would you agree that you were personally 

responsible for destroying her life? 
MR. PIKE; Same act objections. 

A. Her life? 

Q L.M.'s? 

A. I would like to answer that question, 
and J understand how your firm has been accused 
of fabricated sexually charged lawsuits in order 
to fleece investors locally in South Florida. 

‘The U.S. Attorney has called your law firm a 
criminal enterprise based on filing fellacious 

{sic) sexually charged cases. Although I would 

like to answer that question today, Mr. Edwards, 

and Mr. Jaffe, my counsel has told me that I have 

to assert my rights under the Sixth Amendment, 

Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, and if. 
I don't do so, I risk losing their 

representation. 

Q We have a factual basis for asking every 
question and making every allegation. I want to 
provide you with a last opportunity to tell the 
jury which of these allegations, if any, being 
made by L.M., are false or fabricated in any 
way?

MR. PIKE: Same objections, Mr. 
Edwards, you know the tenor of that question | 
cannot be answered without waiver of Fifth, 

Sixth end Fourteenth, | appreciate the 

question and the semantics of it, but it 

is... It is -- can you rephrase it? 

MR, EDWARDS: Yes. 

Q Many times -- you know the aliegations 
now, we've gone through them, L.M.'s allegations 
and assertion of facts as to what happened 
between you and her when she was 13, 14 and 15 
years old and you were 50, $1, 52 years old. 
Several times you responded saying something 
about Rothstein, Rosenfeld & Adler, something 
about her FBI statement, what have you; I want to 
give you a chance to tell the jury, which of her 
allegations, if any, that you believe now are 
false or fabricated in any way. 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A. I would like to respond to that 
question, the fact that her firm, the law firm 
representing her has been accused by the U.S. 
Attomey of being a criminal enterprise, 
manufacturing, fabricating, out of thin air, 
cases involving sexual allegations, sexual 


allegations in order to simply fleece local 

investors out of millions of dollars, so I would 

very much like to answer that question regarding, 

the truthfulness of L.M.'s allegations; however 

today my counsel has told me that I must assert 

my Fifth Amendment rights, Sixth Amendment rights 
and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S, 
Constitution, though I would very much like to 
answer that questions but if I do I risk losing 

their representation. 

Q Would you agree you owe L.M. atleast =| 
$15,000,800 to compensate her for the damage = * 
which you have caused? i 

MR. PIKE: Objection. I move to 

strike. Argumentative. Compound. Lacks 

substantia! predicate, Assumes... facts... 

not in evidence. 

A AS you might imagine, though your law 
firm has been accused of perpetrating a fraud 
involving millions and millions of dollars, on. 
unsuspecting investors here in South Florida, 
millions of dollars by fabricating similar 
allegations, convincing people to give money to 
the firm that helped bring this lawsuit, I'm 
afraid 1 would like to answer those questions but

no matter how much I would like to answer those 
questions, | am going to have to decline based on 
my counsel's advice to invoke, at least today, my 
Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth 
Amendment rights under the U.S, Constitution; 
because if] don't, E risk losing their 
representation, 

Q Is it true that you're currently worth 
more than one billion dollars personally? 

AT would like to answer that question, as 
I would like to answer most of your other 
questions. 1 know that's a lot of money -- 
actually the amount of money that the U.S, 
attorneys accused your firm of trying to steal 
from the people of South Florida. It was 1.2 
billion dollars, the U.S. Attorney claimed your 
firm perpetrated the largest fraud in South 
Florida's history by stealing that sum of money 
from local investors, based on false allegations 
of sexually charged claims, and although | would 
like to answer these questions with specificity, 
under advice of counsel today, I'm going to have 
to refuse, based on my Sixth Amendment, 
Fourteenth Amendment and Fifth Amendment right, 


and though 1 ould ke to answer the question, L 


173 


have been told if I de so I risk losing their 
representation, Mr. Edwards. 

Q I'm simply asking: What is your 
personal net worth at this time? 

MR. PIKE: Form. 

A [think I've answered the question, 
but... 

Q What is your personal net worth at this 
time? So the answer should be a namber or should 
be you invoking your Fifth Amendment rights, 
Seemed like the opposite. 

MR. PIKE: Asked and answered, he did 
invoke his Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth. 

MR. EDWARDS: His answer included 
something about Rothstein, Rosenfeld and 
Adler stealing some certain amount of money, 
which obviously is nonresponsive, F move to 
strike it and ask that he actually responds 
to the question with something that’s 
responsive. He can answer the question, 
invoke Fifth Amendment rights, and we will 
get out of here. 

Q We will start over again. 

Can you please tell the jury what your 

current personal net worth is currently?

AT would fike to do that today, however, 
I'm sure that one of the reasons, since your firm 
has been accused of stealing millions of dollars 
from local investors based on fabricated, totally 
fabricated claims, this is not by me but the U.S, 
Attorney, has called your firm a criminal 
enterprise charged with stealing hundreds of 
mitlions of dollars frankly, from local 
investors, based on faise claims of sexually 
charged nature, I would like to answer that 
question in detail. However, my attorneys have 
advised me I cannot answer any questions that may 
be relevant to this lawsuit and by doing so, I 
must invoke my Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, 
Fourteenth Amendment right and by answering the 
question, I risk fosing their representation. 

Q Is it true you're worth 1.8 billion 
dollars? 

MR. PIKE: Same objection. 
A Same answer. 
Q Put the answer. 
MR. PIKE: For the record. 

A i'm sure that's an interesting question 
and I would like to answer that question for 
you. Tm; sure you would like to know as your 


175 


firm has been charged with stealing over a 
diflion dollars from local investors and your 
senior partner of both you and Mr, Jaffe sitting 
there shaking his head, sits in jail accused of 
fleecing local and foreign investors based on 
false sexual claims from people. And although I 
would like to answer that question, like 1 would 
answer most of your other questions, my counsel 
has advised me today, ladies and gentlemen of the 
jury, I cannot answer that question. Maybe I can 
in the future. However, if I do so today, I risk 
losing their representation, so I must assert 

those rights under the Sixth, Fifth and 
Fourteenth amendments. 

Q You would agree, would you not, that it 
would take a jury award of at feast 45 million 
doliars in punitive damages to punish you for 
doing what you did to L.M.? 

MR. PIKE: Same objections. 

A. I would like to answer that question, as 
1 would like to answer all your other and Mr. 
Jaffe's questions today. However, while he sits 
shaking his head I'm going to have to respond 
to -- my counsel has advised me I cannot answer 
that question today, though I would like to.

Though I would like to answer with specificity, 
however if! do so, I risk losing their 
representation so I must assert my rights under 
Sixth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment. 

Q Isn't it true, Mr. Epstein, that as long 
as you have the money te do it, you will continue 
to engage in sex with minors? 

MR. PIKE: Again, extremely 
argumentative, speculative. I'm allowing 

the question to give leeway, so we don't 

have to come back here again. It is 

harassing. 

A And with that, I'm sure this — ladies 
and gentlemen of the jury, will... be able to see 
you and your partner, who your firm has been 
accused of massive fraud in South Florida trying 
to steal hundreds of millions of dotlars from 
local investors, from creating, fabricating 
malicious, sexually charged claims, called by the 
US. Attorney a criminal enterprise charged with 
money laundering, conspiracy to commit other -- 
federal violations, so though I would like to 
answer that question, Mr, Edwards, and Mr. Jaffe, 
today, cannot. J] must invoke my Sixth, Fifth 


and Fourteenth Amendment rights, on advice of | 


177 


counsel or risk losing their representation. 

@ Am I correct in my understanding that 
you have invoked your Fifth Amendment rights 
because your answers would incriminate you and 
lead to your prosecution? 

MR. PIKE: I'm going to — 
MR. EDWARDS: Exactly as phrased by Mr. 

Luttier to L.M. 1 did not say anything but 

allow her to answer the question, 

MR. PIKE: Object to the fonn. 

A. In fact, since you are a lawyer I'm sure 
you're aware the Supreme Court has said the Fifth 
Amendment is used more often to protect innocent 
people. So that’s — but today on advice of 
counsel I've taken that right. 

MR, EDWARDS: (Gesturing.) 

MR. PIKE: [have no questions. 

We will read. 

MR. EDWARDS: No further questions. 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the video record, 

3:52 p.m,
